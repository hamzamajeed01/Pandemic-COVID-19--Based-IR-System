            "Title: Analysis of 329,942 SARS-CoV-2 records retrieved from GISAID database\n",
            "Body Text : A virus that appeared in Wuhan in December 2019 was not initially expected to cause a worldwide crisis and a deadly pandemic. It was soon recognized as a coronavirus, a single-stranded positivesense RNA virus belonging to a Coronaviridae family, whose members have already frightened humankind before. First discovered in the 1960s, two Coronaviridae family members (CoV-229E and CoVOC43) did not present a global threat (Qi et Walls et al., 2020) . The worst outcomes of the COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, are currently associated with old age (65 and older), male gender, smoking, and comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and hypertension (de Sousa et al., 2020) . At present, over a year and a half later, the reasons for SARS-CoV-2 high transmissibility are still elusive. Most researchers focus on the viral genome, its evolution, and its mutations (Kaur et al., 2020) . Studies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are especially beneficial in revealing heavily mutated genomes and understanding the viral changing pattern (Yin C et al., 2020) . Since common knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 proteins' functioning, signaling pathways, protein-protein, and protein-host cell interactions keeps rapidly accumulating due to its novelty, there is an urgent need to explore the SARS-CoV-2 changes. A relationship between SNPs and their consequences can be predicted from genotyping, protein analysis, and transmission tracking .SARS-CoV-2 genome was first sequenced in January 2020, a month after COVID-19 became a worldwide alert ., Zhu et al., 2020) . The genome consists of 29903 nucleotides (GenBank accession number MN908947). Its length and overall genetic contents carry little surprise since it has long been established that coronaviruses have ones of the largest genomes amid all RNA viruses (varying from ~26 to ~32 kb in length) (Kaur et al., 2020) . Although many mutations have currently been found in the viral genome , only a few of them are high-frequency:119 SNPs exceed the 0.3% threshold, according to Yuan et al., 2020 . Based on the mutations, eight distinct viral clades have been reported by GISAID and twelve by Nextstrain (by March 2021).Specific SARS-CoV-2 variants caused the most concern. A \"British variant\" (also B. Table 1 . nucleotides long were included in the study, since the smaller sequences did not allow us correctly align all genes of interest. Data filtering was completed as follows: 100% match to a reference genome was required to consider a sequence highly conservative, more than 99% match -to consider it moderately conservative, alignments in a range from 99% to 93% match were marked as low conservative. The genomes that were less than 93% similar to the reference sequence contained lowquality sequences and were excluded from further analysis. As these cutoffs were determined experimentally and we considered all the viral genes separately, we were free from simply deleting all the records containing ambiguous/unidentified symbols (\"N\", \"Y\" etc.). Instead, examining genes separately increased the number of sequences that could be used in the research. If unidentified symbols were determined in the aligned gene, and their count was not equal to the count of SNPs, the sequence was included in the research. Statistical significance was measured using a t-test and Bonferroni correction (for two parametersage and gender). Correlation was measured using Pearson correlation coefficient.By the 8th of January 2021, the GISAID database had SARS-CoV-2 records deposited by 142 countries. Even though more than 329,000 records had been uploaded up until then, these data has limited research potential due to several significant problems. First, some of the uploaded sequences are dramatically smaller than the reference sequence (e.g. <5000 nucleotides) or contain an enormous (more than 7% of each gene of interest) number of ambiguous letters ( Fig.1 . represents the sequence size range obtained for the data used in current research; the smallest sequences were mostly obtained by Sanger sequencing). Another weakness is the lack of automation/control in terms of data entry to the system. That drawback led to numerous misspellings and data variants, along with missing information. Thus, the \"collection date\" field may include a year, a month, and a date, contain only the year, or, for some records, have a wrong year (e.g., 2002 instead of 2020). \"Gender\" and \"Patient age\" parameters are filled only for 23.3% and 23.1% of the records, respectively. The least informative for research is \"Patient status,\" which is not only filled for just 6.9% but also contains hardly interpretable data. Records' bias is another problem. The prevalent number of genomes is uploaded by the United Kingdom (45.3%), USA (18.3%), Denmark (6.7%), and Australia (5.1%), with other countries' input ranging from 3 to less than 1 percent of all records. . The records' bias also affected the patients' status. Some countries presumably uploaded the records with predominantly one or another status (e.g., out of all records uploaded by Brazil, 40% contained patient status \"Dead\").The data were considered for every viral gene separately, except for ORF1ab, which was not considered in the present research. While filtering the data to include only good-quality sequences ( sequences contain stretches with 52 \"N\"s, the \"assembly method\" is filled for 23.5%. Since we could not estimate the assembly method and its parameters, we investigated the most prevalent methods among records containing stretches with 52 \"N\"s. Although further research is limited due to too many variations created by manual system entry, the top assembly method was either \"mapping consensus\" or numerous variations of ARCTIC. Analyzing the conservation of the genes allowed us to get some insights into their importance for the virus and potential treatment (Table 3) . No insertions with a frequency greater than 0.3% were found. Two deletions were identified in the S gene: 21765-ATACATG>A with 4.67% frequency and 21991-TTTA>T with 2.94% frequency.Analyzing genomic data considering the date axis, we were not merely able to determine the most frequent mutations but also reveal their changes through the year (Supplement 2 contains data on SNPs occurring with more than 0.3% frequency among 329,942 viral genomes. Supplement 3 contains charts representing changes by month for each mutation).HDBScan yielded 43 clusters (based on data on SNPs and deletions with a frequency greater than 0.3%; Fig.2 ). Some data did not fit any cluster. According to a correlation coefficient matrix, 69 mutations have correlations with at least one other mutation ( Fig.3 ; larger resolution and lower cutoff may be found in Supplement 4). In total, 160 pairs with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.7 were found (Supplement 5). The statistical and bioinformatic analysis of 329,942 records obtained from the GISAID database yielded data concerning many areas, from database design and medical care issues to genomic mutations and their probable effects. The abovementioned results are discussed below.At the moment, one of the most promising treatment and vaccine targets is the S protein, which enables the virus to enter human cells and is already targeted in such vaccines as Gam-COVID-Vac According to clustering results, it may be proposed that, although \"British variant\" mutational contents may not be expanded due to the absence of the concomitant mutations in the general cohort, there is a proportion of people who got infected with its distinct subtype. The subtype may be characterized by four to six additional mutations, with four being a more frequent option (G28881A, G28882A, and G28883С in the N gene, A23403Gin S, A28095T in ORF8, G25437T in ORF3a).Both clusters containing the \"British variant\" mutations are also the most recent, with a mean upload time of 1.2 months ago (count back from the 8th of January 2021). A mutation in ORF3a (G26144T) that forms a cluster and is featured by increased age (57) , which lets us speculate on the existence of so-called \"Danish\" and \"Australian\" variants.Current research shows that some mutations often present together with one or more others. In total, 160 pairs of mutations with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.7 were found. Most studies in this direction focus on certain concomitant mutations. For example, D614G is often considered together with P323L. Some researchers suggest inability of D614G to cause viral success when presented alone (Ilmjärv et al., 2020; . T85I is noted to co-occur with Q57H, and P504Lwith The most frequent mutation in the analyzed genes is a mutation in the S gene -A23403G (D614G), which is found in 94.15% of all studied genomes and in 99.9% of genomes uploaded in December 2020. D614G is considered to be more infectious than the ancestral form, but not associated with Only three mutations have not been noted in the uploads since the beginning of December 2020:G26144T (G251V) and G25979T (G196V) in ORF3a, which were last uploaded around September 2020 and early December 2020, respectively, and a C28836T (S188L) in the N gene, which was last seen around early to middle November. G251V is revealed to result in the loss of a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase X-box domain and a creation of a serine protease cleavage site (Issa et al, 2020) . Another work states that G251V and G196V might influence virulence, infectivity, ion channel activity, and viral release (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 2020). Might disappearing mutations impact viral fitness or human survival? The data is yet incomplete. However, in the present research G26144T (G251V) was found to create a cluster on its own; the mutation is featured by increased age (57) and increased proportion of women compared to the general cohort.The most recent mutation in the current analysis is A28111G (Y73C) in ORF8, which appeared in the uploaded data about early September 2020. The mutation is included in a B.1.1.7 (\"British variant\") mutations' list. In total, B.1.1.7 is featured by 23 mutations (Rambaut et al., 2020) and is preliminarily reported as possibly associated with an increased risk of death (Frampton D. et al, 2021) . We detected 13/14 mutations not located in the ORF1ab region and associated with the variant in the analyzed data. A T26801C mutation in the M gene was not found among mutations with a frequency greater than 0.3%. Our data yielded two mutations in the same position (freq > 0.3%): C26801G and C26801T. The discrepancy could occur due to the differences in the reference sequences. This, however, cannot be verified as Rambaut et al. did not specify the reference sequence number. We have also considered two other variants that appeared lately -B.1.351 (a variant from South Africa) and P.1 (a variant from Brazil). Nevertheless, out of 8 and 14 non-ORF1ab mutations, respectively, only 2 and 3 were detected in our analysis among highly-present mutations. Consequently, it can be speculated that either a \"British variant\" has more transmissivity compared to the other two variants, or this result is due to a bias because of the number of the uploads.We have revealed that the major drawback of letting the users manually fill the fields of the records led to a loss of approximately 77% to 93% of the data, depending on the parameter. The absence of quality control for genomic data yielded a presence of many sequences significantly shorter or longer than the reference genome (ranging from <5000 to 34000 nt). Many laboratories uploading the data do so significantly later than the sample collection date, some even a year later, which may distort the bioinformatic analysis. Certain laboratories indicate a month and a year, or only a year, of sample collection, omitting the day, or day and month. An important analysis factor is that most data are uploaded by the United Kingdom, which creates an overall data bias towards the UK statistics. As time is a crucial factor in a pandemic, a database update can be recommended in order to increase its value and quality.The cohort studied in the current research is represented by 52% of males and 48% of females (mean values; gender was not indicated for a subset of records (Colvin, 2017) . Russian Minister of Healthcare noted in his speech, dated August 3rd, 2020, that Russian males address outpatient hospitals 2.5 times less often than females, with inpatient estimates being about the same for both genders (reported by TASS). One more explanation is that more people working in the areas related to abundant social contact (e.g., medicine, education) in these countries are women. We suppose that this distribution may also be considered in terms of hospitalization criteria and sex differences between distinct age groups, and therefore leave this question to be still open for discussion.Although mean age across gender-filled records in our cohort was determined as 48 and mean gender as 52% of males and 48% of females, some mutations were characterized by increased or decreased age and shift in male to female ratio. In total, two mutations in the S gene exhibited a decline in more than 10 points (years or percent) for both age and gender parameters. A T24814C (D1084D) could not be further analyzed due to the lack of data. Denmark uploaded most of the records for the SNP (99.28%), but none of them contained patient age or gender. which cannot yet explain our finding (Wang R. et al., 2020.) . Beside the aforementioned data, there are 12 mutations that are 10 points different in terms of gender (Table 5) , and 2in terms of age. Also, as increased mortality risk is associated with cardiovascular diseases , the greater percentage of these disorders and thrombosis in men may contribute to fatality increase among males. A higher case fatality rate could also result from the fact that in general, among intubated patients, men are more likely to acquire ventilator-associated pneumonia (Cook et al., 1998, Ahmed, Dumanski, 2020).In this paper, we have analyzed 329,942 SARS-CoV-2 records obtained from the GISAID database.We addressed the quality of the uploaded records, gender distribution, gene conservation, SNPs, insertions and deletions, clusters, and a correlation coefficient matrix. Our research shows that mutations occurring with high frequency (>0.3%) are not abundant and constitute 155 changes concerning all genes (except ORF1ab, which was not considered in a current work). Many mutations present with concomitant changes, which may alter their consequences for the virus or a human host.

So, if there is no singular definition of risk, how can it be comprehended? To begin, one must become exposed to the debates that surround the controversial term. One such debate is whether risk is socially constructed. Is it objective and measureable, or subjective and immeasurable, and to what degree? To clarify, the objective perspective is referred to as the rationalist approach, and the subjective perspective is referred to as the constructionist approach (Etkin 2016). The rationalist approach puts emphasis on scientific management, statistics, and decision theory in order to control risk. The constructionist approach suggests that \\\"nothing is a risk in itself, but rather that it is a product of cultural, political, social and historical ways of seeing\\\". The above-mentioned debate is one of major standing in the field of risk; however, risk does in fact reflect upon both perspectives. If risk is socially constructed, society has made decisions which have inadvertently determined who is at risk and what the risks are. There are several factors contributing to socially constructed risk, such as minorities, education, disability, elderly and children, poverty, and health (Pine 2009) . A well-developed example of a socially constructed risk faced by many in urbanized areas has been provided by Etkin (2016) in the quote:Allowing housing construction near hazardous chemical plants is a social/political decision that puts people who live there in harm's way. The proximity of residential areas to hazardous industrial ones has become increasingly important due to urban growth.When a person is exposed to a risk, they do not respond to that risk directly; rather they respond to their own perception of that risk. Generally speaking, the average person (non-expert) relies on intuition to assess a risk; this concept is referred to as risk perception. Within social groups, acting powers \\\"downplay certain risks and emphasize others as a means of maintaining and controlling the group\\\" (Slovic 1987) . A common perception found within many industrialized nations is the belief that people are presently exposed to a higher degree of risk than traditionally faced in the past, and risks to be faced in the future will be larger than present risk (Schneider et al. 2006; Etkin and Haque 2003) . The above is a general statement, attempting to express the common beliefs of the population. There is, however, two viewpoints of risk not mentioned in the above-mentioned common perception: lay judgment of risk and expert judgement of risk. Lay judgement is generally a rights-based approach that focuses on justice, uncertainty, who benefits from the risk, who is at risk, and dread. It is important to note that expert judgement is prone to the same biases as laypeople, especially if the experts \\\"are forced to go beyond the limits of available data and rely on intuition\\\" (Slovic 1987) . With that being said, members of the public sometimes do not possess all of the information relating to a certain hazard, and therefore can be misinformed. It is beneficial to embrace both the public and expert viewpoints in order to develop a well-rounded grasp on risk, as both views offer unique intelligence and insight (in H\\u00e9bert 2016) .Research suggests that one of the greatest influences on risk perception is cultural factors causing a distortion of perception that can travel between social groups, potentially distorting the actual/realistic threats. Risk perception is fueled by people's experiences (or lack-of), emotions, and social and cultural factors of the community, along with numerous influencers. Each individual experiences and perceives risk differently and therefore makes it difficult to truly define the concept (Gierlach et al. 2010; ISDR 2004; GTZ 2004) . Risk perception is influenced by direct or indirect experiences of activities, events, and/or technologies; for example, receiving information from news sources, or witnessing a natural disaster such as a severe flood. The characteristics of potential dangers associated with a risk also heavily influences risk perception. People tend to believe that rare, sensational events pose a higher level of risk than more conventional events. People's judgements of risk stem from social learning, peer influences and cultural practices, and are continuously exposed to media reports and other processes of communication. Similar to risk, risk perception is viewed differently by each individual depending on the following factors: the type of risk, the context of the risk, the social context, and the individual's personality. An individual's perception of risk is a motivator, urging community members to spring in to action mitigate, avoid, and adapt to risks (Wachinger et al. 2013) .Some risk analysts regard perception as invalid because they arise from subjective influences. But, to the general public, perception are the only relevant views because they incorporate the expert's analysis together with individual judgement based on individual experience, social context and other factors. The public also suspects that limits exist to what experts know a suspicion that is justified in certain cases (Sj\\u00f6berg 2001) . Table 5 .1 (Smith 2004) analyses differences between risk assessment and risk perception.Lay people perceive hazards differently from technical experts for a variety of reasons, including geographical location and aspects of their personality. For example, rural dwellers often perceive flood hazard perception closer to objectively derived estimates than urban dwellers (Smith 2004; Nirupama and Simonovic 2007; Nirupama et al. 2014) . Group perceptions can easily be influenced by social or cultural factors as the influence of personality is exercised mainly through the so-called 'locus of control'. This classifies people according to the extent that they believe hazardous events are dependent on fate (external control) or within their own responsibility (internal control). In order to reduce the stress associated with uncertainty, hazard perceivers tend to adopt certain recognizable models of risk perception with which they are more comfortable. These can be grouped into three basic types, all of which conflict with more objective risk analysis (Smith 2004 ):\\u2022 Determinate perception: people having determinate perception believe that extreme events, such as earthquakes and flash flooding do exist but they occur in a certain pattern. \\u2022 Dissonant perception: people having dissonant perception believe that natural hazards are freak events that are unlikely to be repeated. \\u2022 Probabilistic perception: people having probabilistic perception accept that natural hazards exist and they maybe random events. Therefore, they do not see any benefit in doing anything about something that is an Act of God. If decision makers responsible for disaster mitigation happen to hold probabilistic perception, they may not support investing of resources in mitigation measures.Social amplification of risk occurs when relatively minor threats elicit a disproportionately strong degree of public concern as demonstrated in Table 5. 2 (Kasperson et al. 1988) . Risks are taken more seriously if they are understood by people as life-threatening, immediate, and direct. This means that an earthquake, a rapid onset event, is normally rated more seriously than a drought, a slow onset hazard. Risk is also perceived to be higher if children are at risk in comparison with seniors. Additionally, lack of understanding of complex technologies associated with factories and chemical industries in the vicinity leads to fear and distrust in technical experts and the authorities. Currently ongoing environmental and climate Adapted from Whyte and Burton (1982) , Smith (2004) change concerns are perceived differently by younger generation than older people whose priorities tend to be around health and safety issues (Fischer et al. 1991) . Awareness is heightened when public health is at stake. For example, the city of Flint, Michigan is facing in the worst public health crisis seen to date in the United States. With Flint's struggling economy, in 2014 the local government officials made a decision to switch the water from being supplied by Lake Huron and pre-treated in Detroit, to be supplied by the Flint River without adding in the anticorrosive agent in order to save the city money. The decision to not add in the anticorrosive agent would cascade in to a major health disaster as entire region was exposed to lead poisoning, as well as exposure to Legionella bacteria for 18 months. The health effects this water crisis caused Flint was unimaginable to the community. The people were unaware that there was lead in the water that could be absorbed through the skin as well as being ingested (Flint Task Force 2016). The community was starting to see the side effects of the water in forms of rashes, eye irritations, and behavioural changes (Gupta et al. 2016) . People are also extremely fearful of nuclear accidents and nuclear power plants and have a great deal of skepticism in the industry. The world has seen accidents such as, the Three Miles Island in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986, and recently Fukushima meltdown in Japan in 2011. The Three Mile Island Unit 2 (TMI-2) reactor, near Middletown, Pennsylvania, USA, partially melted down on March 28, 1979. A combination of personnel error, design deficiencies, and component failures caused the Three Mile Island accident, which permanently changed both the nuclear industry and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Public fear and distrust increased triggering nationwide debate ( Fig. 5 .1) NRC's regulations and oversight became broader and more robust, and management of the plants was scrutinized more carefully. Careful analysis of the accident's events identified problems and led to permanent and sweeping changes in how NRC regulates its licenseeswhich, in turn, has reduced the risk to public health and safety (USNRC 2016).At Chernobyl, Ukraine (part of former Soviet Union - Fig. 5 .2), on April 26, 1986, a sudden surge of power during a reactor systems test destroyed Unit 4 of the nuclear power station. The accident and the fire that followed released massive amounts of radioactive material into the environment. Emergency crews responding to the accident used helicopters to pour sand and boron on the reactor debris. The sand was to stop the fire and additional releases of radioactive material; the boron was to prevent additional nuclear reactions. After the accident, officials closed off the area within 30 km of the plant, except for persons with official business at the plant and those people evaluating and dealing with the consequences of the accident and operating the undamaged reactors. The government evacuated about 115,000 people from the most heavily contaminated areas in 1986, and another 220,000 people in subsequent years (USNRC 2016; UNSCEAR 2008) .The Great East Japan Earthquake of magnitude 9.0 on Friday 11 March 2011 generated a large tsunami that destroyed the Sendai region ( Fig. 5 .3). The earthquake and tsunami caused great loss of life and widespread devastation in Japan. More than 15,000 people were killed, over 6000 were injured and, thousands went missing. Considerable damage was caused to buildings and infrastructure, particularly along Japan's north-eastern coast. The tsunami caused meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant due to the loss of the cooling function at the operating reactor units2 as well as at the spent fuel pools. Despite the efforts of the operators at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant to maintain control, the reactor cores in Units 1-3 overheated, the nuclear fuel melted and the three containment vessels were breached. Hydrogen was released from the reactor pressure vessels, leading to explosions inside the reactor buildings in Units 1, 3 and 4 that damaged structures and equipment and injured personnel. Radionuclides were released from the plant to the atmosphere and were deposited on land and on the ocean. There were also direct releases into the sea. People within a radius of 20 km of the site and in other designated areas were evacuated, and those within a radius of 20-30 km were instructed to shelter before later being advised to voluntarily evacuate. Restrictions were placed on the distribution and consumption of food and the consumption of drinking water. The accident was rated 7 on the International Nuclear Events Scale (INES) due to high radioactive releases (IAEA 2013; Pletcher 2016).The media has a fascination with disastrous events, influencing and inflating public anxiety and perceptions of danger (Borum et al. 2010) . When events such as school or college shootings occur, public fear is heightened due to the fact that schools are portrayed as a safe place for children (Lindle 2008) . Like the general public, teachers hear about school shootings occurring, exacerbating their existing fear of violence against children. Similarly, wild/forest fires that have potential to engulf communities and explosions caused by various reasons with a potential to hurt communities receive much and prolonged attention by the media. People are generally fearful of fires due to their destructive nature and stomach turning reaction to burn injuries or death. They provoke extreme passion in people's minds. There are also advantages to media attention in that it creates awareness, emotional engagement, and encourages donations and other forms of help by local, national, and international community. A recent example of a forest fire is Fort McMurray, Alberta fires in May 2016. Being an oil patch of Canadian Midwest, the community sits on the fringes of natural forest creating an easy access for a forest fire to spread to the community. This phenomenon is known as interface fire which is becoming far more common due to various reasons. The soaring 32 C temperatures fueled the fire and tinder dry forest fire swept through the community destroying homes and buildings and forcing the largest wildfire evacuation in Albertan history. It continued to spread across northern Alberta and into Saskatchewan, consuming forested areas and impacting Athabasca oil sands operations until mid-June when rain helped firefighters to hold the fire (Ramsay and Shum 2016; Parsons and Graney 2016) . It has become the costliest disaster in Canadian history. The fire destroyed 2400 structures, nearly 10% of the city, and forced more than 80,000 residents to flee. As a risk mitigation effort, Alberta instituted a province wide ban on open fires, including campfires and the use of charcoal briquettes (Globe and Mail 2016). According to the International Disaster Database (www.emdat.be), vulnerability is degree of loss (from 0% to 100%) resulting from a potential damaging phenomenon. The Public Safety Canada (PSC 2012) describes vulnerability as, a condition or set of conditions determined by physical, social, economic and environmental factors or processes that increases the susceptibility of a community to the impact of hazards.Also defined in the PSC (2012) report is the vulnerability assessment, as the process of identifying and evaluating vulnerabilities, describing all protective measures in place to reduce them and estimating the likelihood of consequences. Nirupama 2013, 2014a, b; Stewart 2007; Tierney 1999; Hewitt 1997; Whyte and Burton 1982) that certain people are more vulnerable than others due to various reasons such as lack of education and adequate income, age, poor health, physical disability, and living in hazardous locations. Many times, vulnerable people living in hazard-prone areas do not perceive their exposure to risk concerning enough to becoming their top priority (Nirupama 2015) as basic necessities of life remains their main focus. Perception about people's behaviour during emergencies defines, to a large extent, how authorities would plan resource allocation for community emergency response as well as develop and implement mitigation measures. During the past decade, a paradigm shift in the approach to disaster management has been apparent and community participation is being encouraged by policy makers. It is believed that community participation, not a top-down approach, will bring about a comprehensive and accurate appreciation of people's perception regarding hazard risk, vulnerability, and resilience. Experts (Wisner et al. 2004; Ferrier and Haque 2003; Twigg 2007; UNISDR 2001) have also delved in explaining the progression of people's vulnerability by employing various arguments given the social, physical, and political environments. Birkmann (2006) has developed indicators for identifying and assessing vulnerability. Emphasis on assessing people's vulnerability and potential risks they may be exposed to, in order to mitigate losses through knowledge based actions, is clearly noticeable (Cutter 2012; ICSU 2008; Pelling 2003; Jaeger et al. 2001; Tobin and Montz 1997) preference as a way to go forward.In the flood risk mapping methodology developed by Armenakis and Nirupama (2014a) , it is clearly demonstrated (Fig. 5.6 ) that accurate understanding and estimation of various types of vulnerabilities play vital role in the process of risk assessment.According to Mileti and Fitzpatrick (1991) , we process information in five different steps: hear, understand, believe, personalize, and decide/respond. In having others help us process information, we are able to legitimize the source of the information, assess its credibility, and confirm the best course of action based on the actions, those around us, wish to take. Knowing better leads to doing better which leads to action that would be based on sound information. For example, living near a railway track can be associated with potential risks such as train derailment, harmful emissions, toxic spills, fires, and explosions. This was the case in 2015 when a small engine fire from a train left oil and debris on various properties in Mississauga in the GTA, presenting a health risk to residents (City News 2015). A program with policies and procedures designed to consider cultures and community needs will not only benefit the community tremendously, but also allow for knowledge-based and well understood perceptions of people. Another major accident occurred in July 2013 when a train carrying inflammable petroleum crude oil derailed and exploded in the downtown area of in Lac-M\\u00e9gantic, Quebec. Figure 5 .7 shows the route of the train with Canadian cities on the track drawn on Google map, and Fig. 5 .8 shows the extent of damage. The tragedy triggered a feeling of deep grief and sorrow in the close knit community, and a movement to move the rail track away from the town. Media reported conversations with impacted people in which they openly expressed their lack of trust with the authorities, including the Transport Safety Board of Canada and the Government of Canada in terms of how risks are being managed. People also perceived the situation as a case of companies putting their interest and convenience ahead of the safety of people and the environment, and impact on communitiesboth emotional and physical.In Toronto, Canada, though the exponentiallyincreasing number of immigrants from around the world is a positive sign, new challenges arise from the standpoint of emergency management, institutional culture and practices. Proper governance is vital to creating an environment that would help new immigrants integrate in the society. According to the 2006 Census (Statistics Canada 2008), Toronto is one of the only four census divisions where more than 16% new immigrants (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) fall in the low income category -5% higher than the national average. Ontario is the largest population centre; ten of the top twenty-five most populous Canadian municipalities are in Ontario, Toronto being number one at more than 2.5 million. Ontario is home to more than half of Canada's visible minorities, out of which more than 30% reside in the GTA, while the national average is only 16.2%. Though two-thirds of Toronto's adult population has completed postsecondary education, the percentage of allophones (persons whose first language is neither English nor French) is as high as 86% in several prominent municipalities. Employment numbers are discouraging, and newer dwellings are built further away from places of workan additional contributing factor in the progression of vulnerability. In this scenario, it is prudent to pay attention to how vulnerabilities are perceived by policy makers with regards to emergency management and how they might impact potential disasters (Mileti 1999; Mitchell 2003; Tierney 2007) . Two studies are discussed in this section to illustrate the role and importance of people's perception of risk and vulnerability. The first study (Nirupama and Maula 2013) is based on a focus group session conducted at the South Asian Women's Centre (SAWC) in Toronto, Canada (Fig. 5.9 ). The participant women in the group were regular members of the Centre, using the resource because they were vulnerable in more than one way. They were mainly over 40 years old, the majority with little education, unemployed, facing language barriers, low income group, and reliant on public transit. Many participants identified that they lived in the vicinity of rivers, lakes, railways, or power plants (Fig. 5.10 ), but did not seem to be aware of their exposure to potential threatsindicating a lack of awareness and engagement with their surroundings. Figure 5 .11 is an example that participants did not understand what was meant by level of safety, exposure to risk, and sense of belonging in their community as most of them chose not to respond to the question. Figure 5 .12 illustrates group's interest and involvement in local government.The second study was carried out in the Region of Peel in the GTA (Fig. 5.13 ) in Ontario, Canada (Nirupama and Jubril 2016; Jubril 2016) . The Region of Peel has a Regional Emergency Management (REM) program in place. A survey conducted by the REM highlighted that among immigrants and visible minorities, presence of fire safety devices and other precautionary measures are less common; and there is a lack of social support for emergency situations. This research is based on the premise set by the REM survey to further explore people's knowledge, preferences, interests, priorities, and perceptions in order to identify strengths and weaknesses in the society. A questionnaire based survey was used to collect data from three different community locations in the City of Brampton, namely, South Fletcher's Sportsplex . The questionnaire consisted of 29 questions intended to gather information from a sample of entities for the purpose of constructing attributes of the larger population of which the entities are members. Figs. 5.14 and 5.15 represent people's responses on questions such as, proximity to potential risks (Fig. 5.14) , importance of social networks (Fig. 5.15 ), level of safety in their community (Fig. 5.16) , and people's interest in the local government (Fig. 5.17) .It is apparent from the responses in the two case studies that to a certain degree, people understand the importance of social network but they do not see a need to There is also a lack of awareness and understanding in regards with what is meant by potential risk, as a number of responses were 'other', 'not applicable' or 'no response'. People's perception on issues concerning assessment of their vulnerability in the context of their society must be observed after disseminating sufficient knowledge in addition to making efforts to attract their attention to the importance of such issues. Particularly with an emphasis on how cultural myths and false beliefs affect decision-making, various authors have discussed barriers to good disaster management (e.g. Der Heide 1989; Alexander 2002). These include: post-disaster recreation of vulnerability; removal of natural protective barriers; failure to learn from the mistakes of others; failure to correct existing but known deficiencies; overdependence upon technology; lack of recognition of system problems; the inter-governmental paradox; institutional ambiguities; apathy; underestimation of risk; overestimation of capacity; lack of resources; cultural attitudes, such as fatalism, defeatism etc.; social pressures; opposing special interest groups; and reliance upon myths/false beliefs in disaster planning, response and management. Research in the nascent field of disaster management suggests that it is often ineffective because of a large number of reasons. How the professional emergency management community perceives barriers that hinder effective emergency management and views itself may provide useful insights, and suggest strategies that might be used to help develop a culture of safety (Nirupama and Etkin 2009) .The way many disasters unfold can be attributed, in part, to a lack of institutional preparedness and a general perception of risk (Whyte and Burton 1982; Slovic 2000; White et al. 2001; Alexander 2002; Twigg 2007; Olanubi 2009 ). To better understand this issue, Nirupama and Etkin (2012) conducted a study to obtain insights into the minds and thoughts of emergency management professionals in Ontario, Canada. In order to assess how emergency management institutions perceive their importance in terms of Canadian society and the Emergency Management community the authors interviewed a number of experts positioned in policy-making and decision-making capacities. Based on these interviews, a questionnaire was prepared that highlighted some major concerns such as disaster myths/false beliefs, institutional barriers, knowledge limitations, cultural barriers, and resource limitations. In total nine experts (three per sector) in emergency management were interviewed from (a) the public, (b) the private and (c) non-profit sectors in order to ascertain their opinions and perspectives on cultural and other barriers to risk reduction. Specific agencies targeted include (a) Emergency Management Ontario, Public Safety Canada, and Health Canada, (b) Bank of Montreal, IBM, and Ontario Hydro and (c) Red Cross, Salvation Army, and Canadian Centre for Emergency Preparedness. The interviews were semi-structured with open-ended questions to elicit rich details on the barriers to emergency management in Canada. Further, the open-ended format minimized the influence of researchers' biases on the issue. These interviews were taped and anonymous. Post interview analysis highlighted the attitudes and perceptions of the interviewees, with respect to themselves, their own organizations, their role in emergency management in Canada and their clients.The questionnaire that was prepared based on these expert interviews was employed to conduct an anonymous survey of approximately 70 emergency managers in Ontario with the assistance of the Ontario Association of Emergency Managers, which is the provincial professional organization for emergency managers. Twenty-four or 34% of the surveyed people replied.Generally speaking respondents scored emergency management institutions as having an average performance with the exception of their own, which they tended to rate as significantly higher than others. Most of them asserted that the amount of education and training they had received in their field was good or very good. This might not necessarily reflect a disinterest in improving job performance. The half of the respondents that were undecided might hesitate due to other concerns, such as being at the twilight of their career, potential costs or the difficulty of balancing further education with career and family. One respondent felt that it is better to use proven procedures and techniques rather than pursuing \\\"new creative ways of doing things\\\". For those that wanted further education/training, IMS (Incident Management System) was the training identified most as being needed. On deciding whether or not to take further education or training, two-thirds of the respondents said they would prefer short courses. A number of them also proposed online courses, as they are convenient.Emergency managers' views were sought regarding whether a Command & Control hierarchical model would be preferred over a Community-Based one (Fig. 5.18 ). The question was in the context of the four phases of the Emergency Management Cycle, namely, mitigation and prevention; preparedness; response; and recovery. This question was placed within the following context: Two different models of emergency and disaster management are (a) one that is top down, command & control, and (b) another that is community based. Hierarchical command and control models based upon a pyramidal authority structure have been criticized as not being the most effective for handling complex disasters. In particular, it has been suggested that they insufficiently incorporate local concerns, authority, culture and expertise. Community based models that encourage such interactions can often be more effective. From an alternate perspective, President Bush after Hurricane Katrina said \\\"It is now clear that a challenge on this scale requires greater federal authority and a broader role for the armed forces. . .It is not surprising that command and control was emphasized more in the response phase. It is much easier to implement community based approaches during normal day-to-day non-emergency operations where there are few time constraints and decisions are not urgent. During crisis situations such approaches are far more challenging. What is surprising is that so many preferred a command and control approach during the mitigation and prevention phases; in the personal experience of the authors emergency managers often prefer community engagement in this part of the cycle. One of the most notable features of Fig. 5 .18 is a large variance in terms of how the respondents viewed command-and-control versus community-based approaches. Recent academic literature has emphasized problems with top-down management structures and emphasized the importance of including community involvement (e.g. Mileti 1999; Canton 2007 ). In part this may reflect a tendency for emergency managers to come from military or first responder backgrounds, where this approach works well and is the basis for much of their training and work.Information sharing came up as an important component of EM as can be seen in the select four quotes from the 'comments' section of the survey, as given below:How can you expect members of the community to become involved if they aren't aware of the risks they face?Agencies and jurisdictions are dependent upon one another, and all elements of the community are dependent upon a number of critical infrastructure sectors/organizations. Time and again at tabletop exercises, participants discover that there are greater interdependencies (Nirupama and Etkin 2012) than they had previously anticipated. More robust and systemic information sharing would minimize this kind of surprise, and often these moments of \\\"Oh? We didn't know that!\\\" are the most useful outcomes of multi-party and multi-sector exercises.Emergency events don't respect geographical boundariesneither planning nor response should be done in a vacuum.Public has a right to know and to be informed. Public is responsible for themselves and must educate and prepare accordingly. I believe IS promotes resiliency.On the contrary, few but striking arguments were presented against information sharing:Restricting the information received on a community's vulnerabilities, would be in our best interest.Encouraging information sharing can be a difficult proposition to sell because I have noticed that the general perception is that sharing the results of a HIRA would point out where all the vulnerabilities are. That is true to an extent, but that neglects the 'unknown' vulnerabilities that arise from not knowing how our partner agencies, jurisdictions, and critical sectors rely on us and on one another. The general thinking is still that each agency and jurisdiction looks out for itself, particularly at the senior management levels in my opinion, and there is little focus on the overall, coordinated EM and Disaster Response effort. There is information sharing, to be sure, often at multi-party exercises. It is just that I think there needs to be more, and it needs to be integrated into our processes and the way we think about the how and why of information sharing. Figure 5 .19 illustrates the responses concerning possible hindrances to effective and efficient emergency and disaster management. Even though 79% of the responses blame insufficient funds, some noted that effective programs and policies are also necessary that would make emergency management a greater part of Canadian culture. A large number (75%) also thought political factors are a major barrier to emergency and disaster management. Many felt that there is a lot of \\\"politicking\\\" when it comes to emergency management, thus action is not taken until forced (the 2003 SARS crisis was given as an example). By politicking we refer to the need to engage in the political process to obtain resources, conflicts between Fig. 5.19 Hindrances to disaster and emergency management (Nirupama and Etkin 2012) . The question was designed to seek more than one response from respondents suggesting their preference, which is why the total percentage of all categories combined is more than one hundred percent various organizations, and difficulties in convincing decision makers to invest in emergency management during non-emergency periods. Some expressed the opinion that politicians do not take EM seriously because they do not see how it would translate into votes.While few professionals expressed concern that the institution is too bureaucratic and too slow to react, others wanted to see more advertising and awareness campaigns being initiated. Regarding the federal initiative, National Disaster Mitigation Strategy, it was felt that the document, despite being great, lacked a cost/benefit analysis and support for mitigation measures, and instead focussed on the costs of response and recovery. Furthermore, not so optimistic comments were also found in the interviews, suggesting that there is a lack of familiarity with the mitigation strategy, and that governments simply legislate and make more rules without actually implementing much.Based upon the set of disaster myths listed in Alexander (2002) (see Appendix 4 for \\\"reality\\\"), the following statements were made, with which the practitioner was asked for their level of agreement (1 \\u00bc agree and 10 \\u00bc disagree):\\u2022 After a disaster, survivors tend to be dazed and apathetic: half the respondents did not disagree with the claim that disaster survivors are dazed and apathetic, though some noted that it depends on the type of disaster. \\u2022 Looting is a common and serious problem after disasters: 46% agree that looting is a common problem after disasters. \\u2022 Disasters give rise to spontaneous displays of antisocial behavior: fifty eight percent disagree with the assumption that disasters give rise to spontaneous displays of antisocial behaviour. In general, the survey respondents feel that people who survive a disaster display pro-social behaviour in the immediate aftermath. \\u2022 Any kind of aid and relief is useful after disaster, provided that it is supplied quickly enough: fifty four percent of the respondents said that not all aid or relief is useful after a disaster. This group felt that only solicited aid is useful, as uncoordinated supplies are often a hindrance. One noted that if relief is to be sent, it should be specific to the needs of the people. Another good point was that if the aid required a substantial amount of resources to manage, it would be more of a hindrance than a help, as EM teams might be put to better use the resources elsewhere. \\u2022 People will flee in large numbers from a disaster: thirty four percent of respondents were confident that people tend to flee.The responses on disaster myths suggest a positive bias since a large proportion of the emergency managers subscribed to common disaster myths. This is a well known phenomenonwhere people tend to view themselves and the world in a considerably more positive light than is objectively justified (Bazerman and Watkins 2004) . This result is similar to the findings of Fischer (1998) who found that the frequency of belief in myths by emergency managers was independent of years in the job or experience, but only depended upon level of education.To summarize, emergency managers felt that priority of the institution should be to mitigate impact on people and assets. They acknowledged that not enough time is allotted to fill gaps and consequently, occasionally same mistakes are repeated. Disaster scenario simulations reveal that there are greater interdependencies than anticipated. The role of Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment at the provincial level was felt vital. It was recognized that risk and vulnerability assessment and prioritization is pivotal for making connections with disaster mitigation strategies and resource allocation. In accordance with what Etkin (1999) presented regarding risk transference and related trends, we notice that the process of risk assessment lies more within the jurisdiction of municipalities and cities than at higher levels of government.Identify three recent disaster events and analyze them from different perception point of view -(i) how impacted people reacted to the event(s) (ii) what you think of the extent of vulnerability in the impact region(s) (iii) how first responders and the authorities perceived the event(s).\",\n          \"The increasing media attention on the emergence of infectious diseases in the recent decade, has heightened the concern regarding travel destinations. The media began intensively covering outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in Brazil in February 2016, highlighting association of the virus with microcephaly, as well as the challenging efforts in controlling the Aedes mosquito vector. A prominent publication advocating cancellation of the Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro (Attaran 2016) highlighted the fact that the emergence of infectious diseases in travel destinations could often result in cancellation of travel plans and events of mass-gathering.An endemic status or prolonged transmission of infectious diseases can also impose potential economic loss to travel destinations. Higher risk of malaria with weaker health infrastructure at Lombok, Indonesia, was identified as the component hindering investment and tourist choices of destination (Kinzer 2010) . Deteriorating profitability of businesses could result in unemployment, which might give rise to social issues.Both emergence and prolonged transmission of infectious diseases could threaten health and life, of not only travellers but also local people. It is thus essential for travel destinations to prepare for, and respond to, threats of infectious diseases. Reduction in such health risks for the well-being of travellers and locals should be of interest to the travel and tourism industry, in addition to local governments in travel destinations.Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne infectious disease in the world today. The disease is endemic in many popular travel destinations in tropical and subtropical countries (Wilder-Smith and Schwartz 2012), including Hawaii, the USA (Effler et al. 2005; Johnston 2016) and Bali, Indonesia (Yoshikawa and Kusriastuti 2013) . The influence of cruise tourism on the incidence of DENV infection in Aruba, in the Caribbean, has also been noted (Oduber et al. 2014) . Travel is an accounting factor for the transboundary spread of infectious diseases (Rigau-P\\u00e9rez et al. 1997) , whilst risk of DENV infection to travellers to Southeast Asia is cautioned (Jelinek et al. 1997) .The female Aedes (Stegomiya) mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse), mediate the spread of DENV infection, for which a specific treatment is unavailable. The vaccine launched in 2015 is not widely propagated, in part due to its ineffectiveness against the DENV-2 serotype. Other vaccines are still under development. This leaves only a couple of options, including reducing mosquito vector populations, and promoting behavioural changes for people to prevent themselves from being bitten by mosquitoes.Controlling the Aedes mosquito is very important, since Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and ZIKV are also mediated by the same vector. Locations reporting local DENV infection might well plan and implement prevention and control strategies against CHIKV and ZIKV infections. For example, Singapore-an urban tropical travel destination-started preparation for the Zika threat as early as September 2013, when an outbreak occurred in the Pacific Islands. Local outbreaks of ZIKV infection, which subsequently surfaced in Singapore in August 2016, were contained in about just 2 months. The well-established national dengue control programme was expanded to respond to the Zika outbreak, and included intensified mosquito control measures and multi-lingual public communication and outreach efforts (Tan and Tang 2016) .DENV infection causes a spectrum of illness, ranging from asymptomatic or mild febrile dengue fever (DF), to severe and occasionally fatal dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The clinical symptoms of CHIKV infection include severe and sometimes prolonged incapacitating arthralgia. ZIKV infection tends to cause asymptomatic to mild disease, but association with severe symptoms such as Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 Syndrome (Cao-Lormeau et al. 2016 ) and microcephaly, has been noted (Pan American Health Organization 2015). The social burden of diseases can be heavy if a large portion of the community or a labour force misses work. Key family members may become unable to provide care for children and the elderly (Ng and Hapuarachchi 2010; Yoshikawa and Kusriastuti 2013) .Lying east of Java, the main island of Bali is located in the Bali Province of the Republic of Indonesia. The province is about 5780 km 2 in area, and is situated south of the Equator in a tropical climate zone. Bali Province comprises the capital city, Denpasar, and eight districts (Fig. 1) . These are divided into 57 sub-districts, which are further divided into 716 official administrative units of villages (as of 2015) . In addition to the beaches, the fertile soil in Bali, supporting rice cultivation on broad and terraced slopes, boast breath-taking beauty. The peaceful, vibrant and rich culture of Bali is well-known amongst travellers, and the unique blend of Hindu and other religions is just another enticing charm of the resort island.The revenue generating travel and tourism industry in Bali attracted the attention of the central government, who have notably developed and promoted this 'island of gods' since the 1960s. These efforts were followed by a national tourism policy and series of development plans, which won the support of international organisations, such as the United Nations Development Programme (Lewis and Lewis 2009 Today, Bali is 'the tourism capital of Indonesia', and tourism is 'the engine of the economy of Bali' (Antara and Sri Sumarniasih 2017) . The researchers note that tourism in Bali generates sources of foreign exchange and taxes; provides a potential market for goods and services produced by the locals; increases community income; creates job opportunities; and supports the activities of artists. Whilst there are no statistical data reporting about tourism in any one category, data combining 'trade, hotel and restaurant' are available. Contribution by the combined sector to Bali's GDP showed an average of 29.1% between 2010 and 2014. In 2014, the combined sector represented 31.35% of the provincial GDP, followed by agriculture (14.64%), transportation and communication (14.22%) and services (13.23%). The percentage of the combined sector would increase if relevant items from transportation and communication, as well as services, are included.However, the social implication of tourism in Bali is rather controversial. Large tourism development works in the 1990s were seen as costs to the environment and culture in Bali (Warren 2007) . Environmental stress was attributed to the uncontrollable construction works of tourist facilities (Kinzer 2010) . The list of stress includes: forest destruction, land degradation, air pollution, seawater pollution, river pollution, rubbish and waste issues, coral reef damage, and mangrove degradation (Lewis and Lewis 2009 ). Indeed, the development in Bali surpassed the preservation of locally specific characteristics attracting tourists (Kotler et al. 2003) .Furthermore, the 'commodification of lands in Bali' resulting from conversion of agricultural fields to tourism areas, was an issue (MacRae 2003). Many Balinese suffered from the losses of lands that were literally taken away by force for the sake of tourism development (Reuter 2003) . Thus, some hotels in Bali are not on good terms with the neighbouring community, even today. To make the situation worse for the locals, about 85% of US$16 billion in tourism assets actually belonged to investors from outside Bali, which has invited repeated criticism of local media (Warren 2009 ). The luxurious hotels sector attracted waves of investment from Asian conglomerates from Jakarta, and other capital from international hotel chains (Kinzer 2010) .Occasionally, the travel and tourism industry in Bali experienced setbacks. Tourist arrivals and revenue dropped in so-called 'the last paradise on earth', after the devastating bomb explosion in Legian Street on 12 October 2002. There were over 202 deaths, including: 88 Australians, British, American, Japanese, Brazilian, German, and French nationals (Berger 2013; Henderson 2003; Lewis and Lewis 2009 ). This incidence was soon followed by the global outbreak of SARS and the Iraq War. As people reduced or postponed travel, tourists immediately abandoned Bali, and the recession in the tourist sector continued in 2003 (Schulte-Nordhold 2007) .The tragedy was repeated in Kuta Square and Jimbaran Bay on 1 October 2005, when another terrorist attack shook confidence in Bali's safety and security. Consequently, 40% of the population experienced a reduction in wages, whilst thousands in the travel and tourism industry were laid off (Schulte-Nordhold 2007) , leading to the 'post-bombing downturn' (Vickers 2012) . However, the industry demonstrated resilient recovery, due in part to the promotion of international tourism marketing and the efforts to improve safety and security in response to terrorism threats (Carlsen and Hughes 2010) . Additionally, the new visa policy was implemented (Thirumaran 2009) , which provided travellers with the flexibility to obtain a visa upon arrival.The total number of foreign tourist arrivals to Bali in 2015 was 4,001,835. Table 1 shows figures with a breakdown of the top five important markets in Bali, for the period from 2009 to 2013: Australian, Chinese, Japanese, Malaysian and Singaporean nationalities. The domestic tourist arrivals also showed strong and promising growth: 6,394,307 in 2014 and 7,147,100 in 2015, far exceeding the total provincial population, which reached 4,104,900 in 2014.As one of the most popular tropical travel destinations in the world, Bali experiences outbreaks of DENV as well as CHIKV infections (Yoshikawa and Kusriastuti 1 3 2013). All 34 provinces of Indonesia report severe forms of DENV infection as DHF, which requires hospitalisation. The national disease trend has generally been on the rise since the 1990s; a record outbreak occurred in Bali in 2010, with 11,697 reported DHF cases (Fig. 2) , including 34 fatalities. Bali has been known as one of five provinces reporting the highest incidence of DHF in Indonesia, and the incidence rate in 2013 was 168.5 cases per 100,000 people. DENV infection is indeed endemic in Bali. The reported fatalities in 2013, 2014 and 2015 were 5, 17 and 28, respectively (Ministry of Health, Indonesia 2011 Indonesia -2016 . Details such as monthly reported DHF cases and those classified by district levels, are compiled by district and provincial health offices. The Ministry of Health collects data from each province on a monthly basis, and publishes the total annual reported cases per province.Denpasar and Badung District accounted for the majority of the reported cases in Bali consistently for years (Yoshikawa and Kusriastuti 2013) . They are the tourist-concentrated areas in Bali. The famous Sanur is in Denpasar, whereas Jimbaran, Kuta, Legian, Nusa Dua and Seminyak are in Badung. Tourists usually move within the island either by car or motorcycle, in the absence of public transportation.The popular tourist-concentrated areas attract local labour force too. Job-seeking migrants from both within and outside the island have been relocating to the tourist spots in Bali, in the hope of benefiting more directly from the economic growth of tourism. The Balinese workers and their families travel frequently between their original communities and their current residences near tourist spots, to fulfil ritual and community obligations of their home villages. The increasing number of tourists and the local population, as well as the inter-and intra-island movements of the people into popular tourist spots, could bring more people in contact with the vector mosquitoes, and hence the viruses (Yoshikawa and Kusriastuti 2013) . It is therefore important to control the disease-mediating mosquito populations. However, there is a possible adverse impact of decentralisation on the public health response to infectious diseases in Indonesia, to which Bali is no exception. There is the Provincial Health Office located in Denpasar, which reports to the Governor. The health office in the capital city, Denpasar, and all district health offices in eight districts, report to each respective mayor. Under circumstances where it is challenging for the fragmented health authority to carry out coordinated and sustainable operations for dengue prevention and control, the respective health offices of Denpasar and Badung have mobilised an NGO workforce, locally known as Jumantik (larvae inspectors). These workers visit residential areas regularly to check for mosquito breeding, and occasionally provide public health education to the local residents (Yoshikawa and Kusriastuti 2013) .In contrast, other private areas in Bali, namely resort hotels, and hundreds and thousands of international travellers, remain out-of-reach in Bali, since information dissemination on dengue by the government is given in the Indonesian language. Frequent dengue incidence amongst international travellers could promote DENV transmission, which could increase exposure of the local people to the virus. It is therefore important to reach out to international travellers, who tend to arrive unaware of health threats due to mosquito bites, and with insufficient knowledge of local disease patterns, high-risk areas of current outbreaks of infectious diseases, and personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites.The insufficient knowledge and action amongst international travellers might partly explain why other countries such as Italy (Rovida et al. 2011; Zavattoni et al. 2016) , Japan (Fukusumi et al. 2016; Yoshikawa 2011) and Australia (Ernst et al. 2015; Warrilow et al. 2012) continue to report dengue cases amongst travellers returning from Bali.The questions remain: where can health education for international travellers take place? What can be done to improve mosquito control at tourist spots? More critically, who can assume a role in reaching out to international travellers, and strengthening mosquito control at tourist concentrated areas?There are complicated logistical issues to overcome at the major point of entry for international travellers, the Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar, in providing information on DENV infection. Individual shopkeepers and restaurant workers usually only have brief encounters with international travellers. In contrast, hotel personnel have personal interaction with travellers, daily and frequently. It is therefore worth studying the readiness of hotel personnel in taking the initiative to educate international travellers on dengue prevention and control, in addition to ensuring that anti-mosquito measures are carried out at the hotels.Although previous research efforts have paid considerable attention to the public health intervention of DENV infection, often carried out by governments, many less studies have been conducted on the scope of a more socially-oriented approach to improve dengue prevention and control at travel destinations. Control measures practised at tourist accommodation facilities have been insufficiently documented, including in Bali.Traversing the disciplines of Travel Medicine, Entomology and Business Administration, the ultimate purpose of this study was to advocate the proactive role of hotels in Bali, in providing information on dengue prevention and control to international travellers. To empower the hotel sector, we found it indispensable to first investigate the knowledge on dengue of the hotel sector, as well as identify gaps in mosquito control measures implemented at hotels. Since promoting population health is essential to achieve development (Yoshikawa and Surjan 2016) , we aimed to improve public health to benefit both travellers and locals in Bali. Such an initiative might assist Bali's efforts in advancing 'Good Health and Well-Being', one of the Sustainable Development Goals.A partnership was formed to launch our study. It included the Bali Provincial Health Office, Denpasar Health Office, Badung Health Office, Bali Hotels Association (BHA), and the authors: an academic researcher from Kyoto University, Japan; the Former Director of Vector-Borne Disease Control at the Ministry of Health, Indonesia; and an Expert Medical Entomologist from the National Environment Agency (NEA), Singapore.In this paper, we present the results of a questionnaire, as well as findings obtained from site visits to several accommodation facilities. We also present previously unpublished details of reported DHF cases from Bali and two other areas in Indonesia. A suggestion is made for the hotel sector in Bali to contribute to neighbouring communities in addition to international travellers, through effective and coordinated mosquito control operations. We conclude that more information and scientific evidence on dengue prevention and control should be provided to empower the hotel sector.We conducted a workshop to reach out to the hotel sector as a public-university-private joint initiative, in Bali on 18 November 2014. All lecturers either self-financed or obtained grants to cover their travel expenses to and from Bali. Educational leaflets distributed to the participants were made available by the NEA, Singapore. BHA, a private sector comprising over 100 hotels in Bali, provided the venue for the workshop. In addition, BHA contacted their member hotels and recruited hotel personnel as participants of the workshop, by recommending that each hotel send a representative to the workshop.The objectives of the workshop were to share information on: (1) current government operations for dengue control in Bali Province; (2) reported dengue cases in the Republic of Indonesia, and the potential influence of climate change on infectious diseases; (3) global burden of DENV infection, and why it is important for hotels in Bali to pay attention; and (4) practical advice on mosquito control.Prior to the workshop, thirty-two hotel representatives who had signed up for the workshop were invited to fill in a questionnaire. There were two representatives belonging to the same hotel, but the others belonged to different accommodation facilities. Information disclosure in written form regarding this research was provided to each participant. Respondents were asked to remain anonymous, by providing no individual or hotel names in the questionnaire.The set of questions and multiple choices are presented in Table 2 . The questionnaire was administered prior to the workshop, so that the contents of the lectures would not influence the responses. Mosquito nuisance problems and existing mosquito control measures at the respondents' accommodation facilities were enquired upon (1-1e, Table 2 ). The respondents' knowledge and opinions regarding DENV infection were investigated (2-2c). General information regarding the hotel guests, as well as their reactions to mosquitoes and a control measure, were garnered (3-3c). Finally, basic information on the accommodation facilities where the respondents work, in addition to the job responsibilities of the respondents, were collected (4-4f).The questionnaire was administered in English, but Indonesian participants were provided with a questionnaire that had been translated from English into the Indonesian language. The translation was verified by two native Indonesian speakers, to ensure accuracy and appropriateness. The respondents were asked to check a box if they would grant us their consent to use the results for our research.Data entry and statistical analysis were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 24. The descriptive statistics of the questionnaire results were examined using a crosstab analysis with Fisher's Exact Test. P values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.As a part of feedback for the workshop, twenty hotel personnel indicated their interest to either: learn more about how to improve mosquito control, or observe mosquito problems on site. In response, we visited eight accommodation facilities between 5 and 10 March 2015. The site visits took place 5 months after the workshop, to allow us to additionally evaluate if our advice for mosquito control at the workshop had been adopted. This paper will include highlights of two-way conversations between the representatives of accommodation facilities and the authors, in addition to our observations and evaluation. Unpublished data was obtained in the form of Excel files by the second author, thanks to the courtesy of the Ministry of Health, Indonesia. The data included monthly reported DHF cases for the years from 2010 to 2015, for each province in Indonesia.The pre-workshop questionnaire was conducted to understand the levels of knowledge on dengue, amongst hotel personnel in Bali. Information on existing control measures and mosquito incidence at the participating facilities was also collected. All 32 members of the audience who attended the outreach workshop agreed to participate in the questionnaire. Data from the forms were anonymised with a number list from 1 to 32, to ensure strict confidentiality of the individuals. All 32 respondents gave us their consent for use of the questionnaire results for research. However, two respondents' returns were excluded from the analysis, due to non-completion of the questionnaire. Therefore, our total sample number was 30, representing 29 accommodation facilities.The areas of job responsibilities of the 30 respondents were: human resources (as specified in the 'other' answer choice) (27%), housekeeping (23%), safety and security (10%), and others such as senior management, engineering and customer services. The accommodation facilities were represented by '5-star rated' (47%), '4-star rated' (40%) and the rest of either '3-star or below' or 'not-rated' hotels.Half of the participating hotels had been in business in Bali for over 15 years, and 33% for 4-9 years. In terms of occupancy rate, 53% of the hotels maintained this at 80-66%, followed by 23% retaining it at 81% or higher. The largest geographical representation was by Seminyak (37%), followed by Nusa Dua (20%), and Legian (13% In terms of the profile of hotel guests, 57% of respondents reported 'children below 12 years of age' comprised below 10% of all guests. Ranking of hotel guests by nationalities revealed that travellers from Australia stayed the most frequently, followed by: Europeans including Russians, Indonesians, Japanese, Chinese from other places, Chinese from the People's Republic of China, and others.The presence of domestic travellers was underpinned by the Indonesians, who were ranked the third.All hotels revealed that their guests reported having been bitten by mosquitoes at their respective facilities (17% frequently, and 83% sometimes). There were equally divided answers to the question of whether the hotel guests had complained of fogging operations.When asked to select all control measures used for reducing mosquito bites experienced by hotel guests, 'fogging' was the most popular answer (87%), followed by 'electronic vaporising mats or equivalent items' (77%), 'aerosol spray of insecticide' (70%) and 'mosquito repellent' (60%). Only 43% answered the action of 'giving mosquito prevention advice to the hotel guests'. One facility mentioned in 'other', the conduct of larval surveillance or control, which is an indispensable measure for mosquito control (Table 3) .As many as 83% of the facilities reporting the use of fogging had outsourced the work to contractors. Frequencies of the fogging operations were as often as: once a week (17%), twice a week (70%) and thrice a week, as specifically described in 'other' (7%). Annual expenditure for fogging in rupiah (approximately 13,320 rupiah to 1 US$) varied amongst the respondents, ranging from 10 million or less (27%); to more than 10 million (30%); to more than 15 million (7%); to over 20 million (30%). The hotels with over 20 million Indonesian rupiah for fogging expense (the highest 1 3 answer choice) revealed the highest number of measures implemented, an average of 5.8 anti-mosquito measures. The 4-star rated facilities, located in Jimbaran, 66-80% occupancy rate (the 2nd highest), 10-14 years in business (the 2nd longest), 10-20% of guests being children below 12 years (the second lowest), and 51-100 employees (the smallest) were other leading indicators (Table 4) . Guests at the hotels where staff reported mosquito nuisance were less likely to complain about fogging operations (P = 0.018). The respondents from '4-star hotels' reported mosquito nuisance more frequently (P = 0.016). The hotels where fogging was conducted 'in-house or by housekeeping staff' were less likely to receive guests' complaints about the fogging operations (P = 0.033). The hotels with over 100 guestrooms were more likely to outsource the fogging operations to contractors (P = 0.018). The facilities with over 66% occupancy rate conducted fogging more than twice a week (P = 0.027). The higher percentage of hotels in Legian and Seminyak had 'over Rp 20 million annual expense for fogging' (P = 0.002), whilst hotels with 'less than 50 guestrooms' were more likely to have paid 'Rp 10 million or less annually for fogging' (P = 0.021). The hotels with 101-300 employees were more likely to 'conduct fogging at public areas' (P = 0.033) ( Table 5) .'Aerosol spray' was likely to be used at the hotels where guests 'complained that the fogging was annoying', (P = 0.020). 'Aerosol spray' was more frequently used by the hotels in Nusa Dua, Legian, and Seminyak (P = 0.036). The 4-star rated hotels (P = 0.029) and hotels in Kuta, Legian and Seminyak (P = 0.048) were more likely to provide 'electronic vaporising mats'. Hotels where guests complained of fogging (P = 0.031) were more likely to provide 'mosquito coils at guestrooms'. Hotels with '201-300 employees' (P = 0.009) were more likely to provide 'mosquito coils at public areas'. Staff at the hotels where guests complained of fogging were 1 3 more likely to 'give mosquito prevention advice' to their hotel guests (P = 0.016). Staff at hotels located in Legian and Seminyak (P = 0.015) with 51-100 guestrooms (P = 0.001) were more likely to 'give mosquito prevention advice' (Table 6 ). There was no statistical significance between 'providing mosquito repellent to the hotel guests' and the characteristics of hotels.We also investigated the knowledge of dengue amongst the participating hotel personnel. All but one answered correctly that DENV infection is due to a virus. Whilst 80% of the respondents understood that dengue could be a life-threatening disease, only 67% knew that dengue is mosquito-borne disease. The staff from hotels whose occupancy rates were 'over 81%' or '65-51%' (P = 0.036), in addition to the personnel whose job responsibilities were in 'human resources' (P = 0.031), were more likely to know that serious dengue is a life-threatening disease. The hotel personnel from Nusa Dua, Kuta, and Legian significantly knew that dengue is mosquitoborne (P = 0.037); 80% of the hotel personnel were aware that dengue is a problem in urban areas in Southeast Asia (Table 7) .We visited eight accommodation facilities in Seminyak, Legian, Jimbaran, Nusa Dua and Ubud, amongst the participating facilities of the workshop. The findings resulting from conversations during the site visits are summarised in Table 8 . They include existing mosquito control measures; whether or not the facility worked with others in the vicinity for the mosquito control operations; special concerns communicated to us by the representatives; and potential mosquito breeding habitats that we spotted. All eight facilities implemented measures to control mosquitoes, but only two facilities coordinated mosquito control operations with other nearby hotels and/ or communities. Three facilities specifically mentioned that their guests reported mosquito bites frequently. Concerns of nearby construction sites were expressed by two facilities. We found a female Aedes aegypti mosquito resting on a bed-net at a guestroom at the facility, which had wide gaps between the front doors of the guestrooms (facility C, Table 8 ). Whilst two facilities kept open jars that could collect rainwater, in the vicinity of villas or in public areas of the facility, two facilities had either materials or waste on the ground with no roof, posing a risk that stagnant water in these spots could attract female Aedes mosquitoes to lay their eggs.East Java Province and DKI Jakarta are two major locations where a significant number of domestic tourists are said to visit Bali. Also, migrants from the two areas move back and forth from and to Bali for either leisure or work. Using data obtained from the Health Ministry, i.e. reported monthly DHF cases for all provinces in Indonesia between years 2010 and 2015, we attempted to determine if there are any seasonal patterns in Bali, East Java and Jakarta, respectively. The reported DHF cases in Bali increased in February in almost all years, and from April to July in some years (Fig. 3) . In contrast, the highest DHF cases in East Java Province were reported in January every year (Fig. 4) . The national capital, Jakarta, reported a higher number of DHF cases in March and/or April in 3 years (Fig. 5) . Clear association of the cases amongst the three areas has yet to be established in the absence of virus analysis, including genetic and serotype information of transmitting viruses. Proactively disseminating dengue information to travellers at hotels could hopefully contribute to travellers' behavioural change, in terms of personal protection against mosquito bites, and awareness to not create mosquito breeding habitats. However, results from both the questionnaire and the site visits suggest insufficiency in mosquito control at the accommodation facilities surveyed. They could benefit from more in-depth scientific information, as well as practical and accurate advice on dengue prevention and control measures, such as source reduction in place of routine fogging.The results of the average number of anti-mosquito measures implemented by the hotels (Table 4 ) contradicted our assumption. We expected that more measures would be implemented by hotels with the highest star-rating, the longest years of business in Bali, the highest occupancy rate, and the highest number of employees. One possible reason might be a component we failed to ask about: the total area size of the hotel. The size of the resort hotel would likely be in proportion to the number of guestrooms. The large area of a facility could make mosquito control a challenging task for the hotel employees. As shown in Table 5 , the hotels with over 100 guestrooms were more likely to outsource fogging operations to contractors (P = 0.018). Furthermore, one facility we visited admitted that it was hard to respond to hotel guests' complaints of mosquito bites in the 8-ha facility (facility E, Table 8 ). Actually, 'mosquito prevention advice' was more frequently given to guests at hotels with only 51-100 guestrooms, which might suggest that personal interaction took place more frequently when there were a fewer number of hotel guestrooms (P = 0.001, Table 6 ) and therefore fewer guests. Due in part to the expenses and intensive labour required for mosquito control, a fewer number of measures were applied at hotels with less than 65% occupancy rates.The highest number of anti-mosquito measures implemented by the 4-star rated hotels (Table 4 ) might be associated with the personal observations of respondents of the questionnaire. In fact, they reported that there were mosquito nuisance problems at their hotels, which was statistically significant (P = 0.016, Table 5) .Although researchers noted a recent shift of DHF incidence from young children to older age groups in Indonesia (Karyanti et al. 2014) , DENV infection had been known as a leading cause of hospitalisation or death amongst children (Gubler and Clark 1995) . Contrary to our expectations for a tropical resort, the majority of our respondents reported that 'children below 12 years of age' represented below 10% of all guests. This result made it difficult to investigate whether or not the presence of young children can be a factor affecting mosquito control measures at the hotels. For example, parents with small children might complain of fogging operations for fear of the possible negative impacts to health due to chemical exposure. There was no statistical significance to support the relationship between 'the percentage of children below 12 years of age' and 'hotel guests complaining that fogging was annoying'.The ranking of nationalities of hotel guests reported by our respondents (represented by Australian, Chinese and Japanese) was in line with the statistics (Table 1) . However, 'Europeans including Russians' might be a unique market segment of our respondents, possibly due to our sample being disproportionate. For example, 37% of the sample was represented by hotels located in Seminyak; 87% represented by 4 star-rated and 5 star-rated hotels.The result that 83% of our respondents reported a mosquito nuisance problem (question 1, Table 2 ) might be understated. This is because all 30 respondents were aware that their hotel guests had complained of mosquito bites at the hotels (question 3a, Table 2 ). The discrepancy might be because the hotel personnel did not link guests' experiences of mosquito bites to a mosquito nuisance problem at their hotels. An overview of the situation in Bali indicates that improved efforts in reducing mosquito populations and bites are essential.There is evidence that routine fogging has been conducted at the hotels surveyed. In fact, 83% of the respondents answered that their 'hotels use fogging for mosquito control' (questions 1a, Table 2 ). Some respondents from hotels outsourcing the operation might have answered 'No' to this question since it was not the hotel itself that conducted the operation. In fact, 29 out of 30 (97%) should have answered 'Yes' if the question had been phrased as 'is fogging operation conducted at your hotel?' This is because answers to question 1c 'how often is fogging conducted?' totalled 29 answers. Also, 87% of the respondents chose fogging as one of mosquito control measures applied at their hotels (Table 3) .Guests staying at hotels where 'in-house or housekeeping staff' conducted fogging operations were less likely to receive guests' complaints about fogging operations (P = 0.033, Table 5 ). This finding might indicate that external contractors were less attentive to the inconvenience of hotel guests, such as the unpleasant smell of chemicals, deterioration in visibility, and noise of the machines during the fogging operations.At hotels where guests 'sometimes complained about the fogging', other mosquito control measures were likely to be additionally used. These included: 'aerosol spray' (P = 0.020, Table 6 ), 'mosquito coils at guestrooms' (P = 0.031), 'give mosquito prevention advice' to their hotel guests (P = 0.016). Whether these additional measures were applied to complement fogging operations, or to respond to the high incidence of mosquito appearance at the hotels, remains unclear.Fogging operations targeting adult mosquitoes should be carried out only when necessary, and not routinely. The high frequency of fogging reported by our respondents (7% thrice a week, 70% twice a week, and 16% once a week) is cause for concern. This is because such high prevalence of routine and intensive fogging can lead to mosquito resistance to chemicals, which could undermine control efforts of the health authorities. Continuous monitoring of mosquito resistance is indispensable.Furthermore, hotels must check if appropriate dilution of chemicals are adhered to by the outsourced contractors. Operations need to be scheduled in consideration of weather conditions, especially wind and precipitation, to ensure the effectiveness of fogging. For example, mosquitoes at one hotel might easily fly to neighbouring areas, such as other hotels or residential homes, during the operations, only to return to the hotel later.Only one facility responding to the questionnaire reported the conduct of source reduction, essential critical measure for mosquito control. The low frequency of removal of mosquito breeding habitats amongst our respondents requires improvement.The hotel employees seemed to have basic knowledge of dengue as a viral infection; only one respondent failed to answer correctly (question 2, Table 2 ). Awareness of the disease burden in urban areas of Southeast Asia was underpinned by 80% of the respondents. It is a concern, however, that 20% of the respondents disagreed that DENV infection could be a life-threatening disease. In fact, there have been deaths reported in Bali, most often due to late medical attention sought at healthcare settings. It was also surprising to learn that only 67% answered that people get DENV infection by mosquito bites. The percentage of correct answers may have increased if the question had asked more specifically whether people get DENV infection by the bites of DENV-infected mosquitoes.As presented in Table 8 , the follow-up site visits at eight accommodation facilitiescarried out 6 months after the outreach workshop-confirmed the mosquito control tools reported by the questionnaire respondents. These included: fogging, repellent, mosquito coil and electric vaporiser. Additionally, we learned that insecticide was used outdoors by four facilities. In contrast to the results of the questionnaire, only three facilities reported routine fogging. However, the answers might have been skewed since the representatives provided the answers to researchers face-to-face, i.e. lecturers of the outreach workshop, during which routine fogging had been cautioned against.The existing linkage or coordination of mosquito control reported only by two facilities warrant further discussion. Given the proximity of resort facilities to other facilities and/or residential areas in Bali (as observed at five facilities), as well as the ecology of Aedes mosquitoes, including flight distance, mosquito control measures undertaken only at one hotel are unlikely to result in effective mosquito control. A study conducted in another island travel destination in Southeast Asia, Singapore, revealed that female Aedes mosquitoes dispersed easily and quickly throughout areas of radius 320 m, in search of oviposition sites (Liew and Curtis 2004). Thus, it may be beneficial for hotels with frequent reports of mosquito bites, such as facilities C, D, E and H, to enquire into the situation of mosquito prevalence and existing mosquito control measures practised at neighbouring facilities and/or communities.Two facilities expressed concerns about the construction works in progress right next to their hotels. The concerns might be due to our explanation at the outreach workshop that mosquito breeding habitats had often been found at construction sites (including locations where renovation works were conducted). Continuous monitoring of outreach efforts is important.Although three facilities paid great attention to their plants and gardens, the same attention must be directed to places where rainwater could become stagnant, which may lead to ideal places for mosquitoes to lay their eggs in. Our site visits revealed that there were jars and materials placed at open areas of some facilities. Improved waste management, such as removal of plastic sheets covering items stored, could also reduce the risk of mosquito breeding.We learned that facilities A and H used temephos (Abate), whilst facility H additionally used predator fish in the pond. Resistance of the Aedes aegypti mosquito towards temephos has been noted (Grisales et al. 2013) , and such resistance has already been confirmed in Bali (personal communication, Denpasar Health Office). However, none of the representatives were aware of the issue. Insect growth regulator (IGR) granules could be considered in place of temephos, to prevent larvae from developing into adult mosquitoes, if hotels can allocate higher budgets for mosquito control. The granules are already used by both health authorities in Denpasar and Badung District.The endemicity of DENV infection in Bali shows active local transmission of the viruses there. Viraemic patients continuously arriving from other endemic locations have contributed to this condition. Although relationships between reported DHF cases in Bali and those in East Java Province or Jakarta are yet to be proven in the absence of virus analysis, the disease situation in these areas might provide an early warning for Bali. This is because significant movement of people, such as domestic tourists and migrant workers, between Bali and these two locations are known. However, the reported DHF cases by month, as plotted in Figs. 3, 4 and 5, are usually available within the health authorities in Indonesia. If the data was made readily available to the managers of healthcare settings in Bali, for example, the medical community might watch out for symptoms of dengue once they had learnt of increases in the reported cases in and out of Bali.Similarly, alertness in Bali could be raised if outbreaks had been reported by countries, especially places from where foreign tourists arrive, as listed in Table 1 .We have hitherto described the DENV endemic situation in Bali, which requires indepth thoughts amongst the travel and tourism industry, especially the hotel sector. The sector should rather view it as an opportunity to contribute to the improvement of public health in Bali. We highlight that there are at least four reasons for the hotel sector to consider assuming a more proactive role in reaching out to the hotel guests. First, Bali's hotel sector would find it difficult to ignore a reputation risk, which would hurt the brand image of Bali. As any hospitality business naturally adopts a business management strategy to lead to customer satisfaction and loyalty, it is important for the hotel sector in Bali to secure a higher rate of repeat customers, as well as to attract new travellers. Plans to return to and endorse the location to others can be affected by brand image, and recommendation is essential for people choosing a travel destination (Alca\\u00f1iz et al. 2005; Bigne et al. 2001) . It is therefore imperative for a travel destination like Bali to offer 'favourable experiences to tourists' (Qu et al. 2011) .Whilst imported cases of DENV infection from Bali are often reported by other countries, this could have negative implications for choice of holiday destination. Since visitors tend to expect accommodation facilities to provide safe and healthy environments, especially at luxurious resorts, we recommend that the hotel sector in Bali improves mosquito control measures and minimises exposure of tourists to mosquito bites. Such a business plan could signal an act of social responsibility, which might help sustain Bali's brand image.Second, protection of travellers should be regarded as goodwill or a practice of customer service by the hotel sector. Although there may be fear in disclosing dengue and mosquito incidence in the tropical resorts, proactively providing health information and improving mosquito control at accommodation facilities, is a laudable act of safeguarding public health for their guests, employees and the neighbouring local communities.Virtually every traveller should ideally arrive with knowledge of mosquitoborne infection and prevention, including personal protection against mosquito bites. Taking this argument further, travel experts assisting travellers in home countries should practice ethical and considerate behaviour. In other words, they are expected to supply information of health risks at the travel destinations. In reality however, travellers are often merely left with no or few choices but to obtain safety and security information by themselves.Under these circumstances, the contributions which the hotel sector in Bali could make are even more meaningful. Whilst accommodation facilities provide mosquito repellent or control products in guestrooms, the decision to use them tends to depend on personal preference and knowledge of health risks amongst hotel guests. Not only could the hotel personnel explain about the correct usage of mosquito repellent, but they could also warn of careless behaviour that could lead to mosquito breeding. Proactive communication can therefore increase awareness of DENV infection, and watchfulness of careless behaviour amongst travellers to Bali.Third, hotels bordering the communities could consider assisting them with mosquito control operations. The coordinated operations could improve effectiveness of their mosquito control approaches. In addition, reaching out to residential areas in the vicinity for protection of the community (in addition to hotel guests and staff), might convey the goodwill of those hotels interested in growing their businesses in harmony with the surrounding communities. Some hotels are adjacent to residential areas suffering from poor hygiene conditions, such as fly infestations, inappropriate disposal management of household waste, and larvae breeding. It is therefore encouraging to know that at least two facilities are in collaboration with the nearby communities (Table 8) . Furthermore, some hotels raise money for the neighbouring communities as charity, and hire a certain percentage of employees from the bordering communities. Funds raised by hotels could be used to train the Jumantik workforce to strengthen its capacity in conducting the source reduction activities in the peripheral villages.Fourth, the hotel sector in Bali, especially the BHA, has experiences in leading response measures toward life-and health-threats in recent years. Understanding a potentially negative image, which crises such as bombs, earthquakes and tsunamis might impose on Bali, the BHA established a new emergency communication network to manage a crisis, collaborating with the police department. The members were given 'direct access to police services' if necessary. The subsequent tie-up with the Provincial Disaster Management Agency Bali, Bali's new disaster and incident management agency, the access has been expanded to army representatives and the Red Cross, to name a few examples (Pennington-Gray et al. 2015) .Although the issue of mosquito control may not be seen with the same magnitude or urgency as natural disasters or terrorist attacks, senior members of the BHA expressed that the hotel sector should regard outbreaks of infectious diseases as crises that could threaten the profitability of hotel businesses. The BHA could promote a concerted approach toward dengue threats amongst accommodation facilities.Needless to say, the hotel sector alone might find it challenging to invest in resources and time, to improve mosquito control operations and disseminate information on dengue prevention and control to international travellers. Academic and government sectors could support such efforts, in areas such as mosquito surveillance and training of staff. This collaborative approach, if developed and sustained in Bali, has the potential to contribute to improving the public health environment at the travel destination, thereby mitigating exportation of DENV infection from Bali.It is possible to say that the sample size of 30 respondents from 29 hotels to our questionnaire was not too small, given that only 100 over member hotels belong to the BHA. However, it was not large enough to represent the population of approximately 1424 star and non-star rated hotels in Bali, as of 2014 (Antara and Sri Sumarniasih 2017) . In fact, our sample lacked balance in hotel ratings, reflecting a high proportion of 4-and 5-star rated hotels amongst members of the BHA. To make the sample more representative of all accommodation facilities in Bali, inclusion of more non-rated and 3-star or below rated hotels would be required. Access to these hotels may be possible if we could collaborate with additional tourism related organisations in addition to the BHA. We also recognised the imbalance of hotel locations in our sample. It may be because we conducted the workshop at a hotel located at Nusa Dua in Badung District, and representatives from hotels at other locations may have found it difficult to travel during the day time on a weekday.The workshop and questionnaire were designed to reach out to and survey hotel staff with varying responsibilities. The fragmentation in job responsibility posed a challenge. Apart from seven staff in housekeeping and eight staff in human resources, others were represented by only three or fewer persons. Hence, statistical analysis by job responsibility was difficult.Our evaluations were affected by the small sample size with the follow-up site visits. We were able to cover only eight out of 20 hotels that requested our visits. The number of facilities was constrained by the availabilities of personnel at the accommodation facilities, as well as by the only 4 days we were able to finance and allocate for this activity in March 2015. Furthermore, the serious island-wide traffic jam was another constraint.Further research on local mosquito vector studies in Bali, including baseline surveillance data, is indispensable to evaluate more effective mosquito control strategies and advice to be given to travellers. For example, personal advice to hotel guests to watch out for mosquito bites outdoors may be emphasised at facilities where the appearance of Aedes albopictus is confirmed in addition to Aedes aegypti (the latter tends to stay indoors). Similarly, if Culex mosquito species (night-biters as opposed to day-biting Aedes species) are additionally present, it is necessary to advise hotel guests to be careful of mosquito bites at night as well.Our follow-up studies therefore include capacity building at hotels, for mosquito surveillance and risk communication, in addition to a survey to investigate evaluation by hotel guests on proactive information dissemination on dengue prevention and control by hotels. To make more concrete recommendations for enhancing the role of the hotel sector in infectious disease prevention and control, expanding the questionnaire survey to collect data from a larger and more representative sample is necessary. For example, the sample should include more non-star rated accommodation facilities, and should be well-balanced in terms of geographical representation. Similarly, visiting a larger number of facilities is required to understand the mosquito control situation. The follow-up studies may help us to understand details of the actual state of mosquito control in more accommodation facilities, which might lead to the identification of contributory factors at accommodation facilities to dengue outbreaks in Bali.Increasing brand equity of travel destinations is vital for the growth and viability of the travel and tourism industry. Given the leading economic contribution of the industry to the economy, Bali cannot afford to continue exporting infectious diseases, such as dengue. Whilst there is widespread and increasing movement of people, such as international travellers, Bali should not wait until the originating countries of these travellers improve public health education. Bali could instead proactively help travellers to gain information on dengue prevention and control.Cautioning travellers appropriately against mosquito bites and improper disposal of open containers is necessary, although it may seem awkward to interfere with the holiday mood of travellers. Since travellers visiting resorts tend to have daily interaction with hotel personnel, we advocate inclusion of prevention and control of mosquito-borne infectious diseases such as dengue into the business strategy of the hotel sector. Such efforts could lead to safeguarding the public health environment at travel destinations, for the sake of not only the travellers, but also of the employees and local people.However, an overview of the situation as a result of this study indicates that additional efforts are necessary to reduce mosquito bites acquired at the accommodation facilities in Bali. Also, the present study suggests that increased knowledge of dengue amongst hotel personnel is essential. Since dengue prevention and control at hotels could improve, as knowledge of the disease and effective mosquito control measures were to increase amongst hotel staff, the hotel sector should be provided with more practical and scientific advice on dengue prevention and control. Such empowerment of the hotel sector is essential to promote the proactive role of the hotel sector.Such a social approach to complement medical efforts may lead to improving public health intervention at travel destinations, including Bali. Indeed, providing a healthier environment to travellers and locals should be understood as a process to achieve 'Good Health and Well-Being' for the Sustainable Development Goal in Bali. As Bali is not the only tropical resort where mosquito-borne infectious diseases are endemic, the collaborative approach in Bali, if further developed and sustained, might encourage the hotel sector at other travel destinations to consider forming partnerships within hotels, as well as with other sectors such as academic and government sectors.\",\n          \"Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that spread directly or indirectly from one person to another [1] . Zoonotic diseases are infectious diseases of animals that can cause disease in humans when the causal agent is transmitted from animal to human; the diseases can account for hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Infectious diseases pose a significant threat to both human health and the global economy; to date, we know of about 200 infectious diseases. Fortunately, only a handful of these diseases are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality [2, 3] . Among them, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), tuberculosis and malaria are the most pronounced. In addition, several outbreaks of infectious diseases One such alternative approach involves nanomaterials and their fascinating properties, which include optimal size, shape, tunable surface charge, superparamagnetism, high surface plasmon resonance, luminescence, photon upconversion, bioavailability, biocompatibility, immunocompatibility/tolerability and biodegradability. Furthermore, the versatility of nanomaterials are can be easily decorated/anchored/conjugated with one or more type of functional groups, linkers and various bioactive molecules and some of the nanomaterials are being capable of simultaneous therapy and diagnosis [42] [43] [44] [45] .In addition, the major requirements including cellular entry through the blood-brain barrier and blood-air barrier, tenability and targeted control discharge are feasible with nanomaterials, thus qualifying these materials as potential novel candidates for use in biomedical therapy [28] [29] [30] Nanoparticles have been widely used in antiviral therapy over the last few decades, owing to the development of surface functionalization strategies [45] . For example, Ag [46] , Au [47] , TiO 2 [48] , SiO 2 [49] , CeO 2 [50] and CuCl 2 [51] nanoparticles have been employed against different viruses including hepatitis B virus (HBV) [46] , H3N2 and H1N1 [52] , HIV-1 [53] , herpes simplex virus (HSV) [54] , vesicular stomatitis [55] , foot-and-mouth disease [47] and dengue virus type-2 [51] . Recently, Sportelli et al. (2020) stated that researchers need to focus on the development of nanomaterial-based technological solutions to fight COVID-19 [56] . Therefore, several articles are expected to provide the basic knowledge regarding nanomaterials and describe how to use these materials for the development of antiviral therapies. Considering the seriousness of infectious disease transmission and the potential of nanomaterials in treating these diseases, our review first focuses on the mechanism of entry of viruses into host cells and then on the use of major and important types of nanomaterials such as silver, gold, quantum dots, organic nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers and polymers against various types of viral infections. Further, we discuss antiviral mechanisms, therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles and the effects of nanoparticles on CoVs. Finally, we provide our perspective on the potential of using nanoparticles in the future to treat infectious diseases.Virus entry into host cells is required for viral multiplication. The infection process involves several steps including attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly and release ( Figure 1 ). Viruses enter host cells through specific receptors on the host cell membrane using attachment proteins in the viral capsid or glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope. The specificity of the interaction determines the kind of virus that infects the host cells. For example, bacteriophages enter the host cell through their nucleic acids and the capsid remains outside of the cell. Some animal and plant viruses enter host cells through endocytosis. Once inside the host cell, RNA viruses such as CoVs, use their genomic for the synthesis of viral genomic RNA as well as Mrna and eventually the release of the new virions produced in the host cells [57] [58] [59] . The human respiratory mucosa is the primary site of virus entry for various viruses including the influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus. These virulent pathogens primarily infect the upper respiratory tract but they may subsequently reach the lower respiratory regions causing more severe illness and ultimately morbidity and mortality. The clinical symptoms of the above pathogen attacks are frequently fever, dyspnea, cough, bronchiolitis and pneumonia [60] . Most respiratory tract infections are caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [61] . A unique feature of CoVs such as SARS-CoV-2 is their mechanism of entry into host cells, initially through binding to the host-receptor cell at the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein site. This is followed by fusion with the host cellular membrane and subsequent release of the viral genetic material into the host cytoplasm or nucleus. The released viral RNA from CoVs is transcribed and the viral mRNA directs protein synthesis. Viruses replicate and assemble into new virions and these are released into neighboring cells via exocytosis. COVID-19 is caused by the novel CoV, SARS-CoV-2 [4, 5] . SARS-CoV-2 is 80% and 50% homologous with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively [4, 62] . Viral diseases are major threat to human health and economy; therefore, it is necessary to find suitable, alternative, safe and biocompatible antiviral agents to prevent the spread of infections and reduce economic losses. Generally, nanoparticles including silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), gold NPs (AuNPs), quantum dots (QDs), carbon dots (CDots), graphene oxide (GO), silicon materials, polymeric NPs, dendrimers and polymers possess remarkable antimicrobial and antiviral activities [1, [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . Therefore, it is essential to highlight the variety and importance of selective nanoparticles that could be used as antiviral agents and delivery agents ( Figure 2 ). Viral diseases are major threat to human health and economy; therefore, it is necessary to find suitable, alternative, safe and biocompatible antiviral agents to prevent the spread of infections and reduce economic losses. Generally, nanoparticles including silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), gold NPs (AuNPs), quantum dots (QDs), carbon dots (CDots), graphene oxide (GO), silicon materials, polymeric NPs, dendrimers and polymers possess remarkable antimicrobial and antiviral activities [1, [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . Therefore, it is essential to highlight the variety and importance of selective nanoparticles that could be used as antiviral agents and delivery agents ( Figure 2 ). Viral diseases are major threat to human health and economy; therefore, it is necessary to find suitable, alternative, safe and biocompatible antiviral agents to prevent the spread of infections and reduce economic losses. Generally, nanoparticles including silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), gold NPs (AuNPs), quantum dots (QDs), carbon dots (CDots), graphene oxide (GO), silicon materials, polymeric NPs, dendrimers and polymers possess remarkable antimicrobial and antiviral activities [1, [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . Therefore, it is essential to highlight the variety and importance of selective nanoparticles that could be used as antiviral agents and delivery agents ( Figure 2 ). Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are used as antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenesis, antiplatelet, antifungal and anticancer agents due to their unique physiochemical properties and superior biological functions [54, 68, 69] . Synthesis of AgNPs is carried out by various physical, chemical and biological methods. Biological methods appear to be environmentally friendly, safe, biocompatible and non-toxic. AgNPs have been used as biomedical therapeutic agents in wound dressings, long-term burn care products and anti-bacterial lotions [70] . Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated AgNPs homogenized in Replens gel (0.15 mg/mL) inhibited HIV-1 transmission of cell-associated and cell-free HIV-1 isolates after 1 min and offered long-lasting protection of cervical tissue from infection after 48 h treatment, with no evidence of cytotoxicity observed in the explants. AgNPs bind to glycoprotein gp120 on the HIV envelope in a manner that prevents CD4-dependent virion binding, fusion and infectivity [53] . AgNP-Coated polyurethane condoms (PUCs) efficiently inactivate HIV-1 and HSV-1/2 and their infectiousness; macrophage (M)-tropic and T lymphocyte (T)-tropic strains of HIV-1 are highly sensitive. The AgNP-coated PUCs can directly inactivate the microbe's infectious ability and provide another line of defense against sexually transmitted microbial infections [71] .Fungi-Mediated synthesis of AgNPs reduced the viral infection dose in a size-dependent manner against HSV-1/2 and with human parainfluenza virus type 3 they blocked interaction of the virus with the cell, which might depend on the size and zeta potential of the AgNPs [72] . Antiviral activity of AgNPs and chitosan composites was evaluated against H1N1 influenza A virus. The composites showed significant antiviral activity in a size-dependent manner; surprisingly, chitosan alone did not show any antiviral effect. Conversely, AgNPs alone did exhibit antiviral activity; however, the composites showed remarkable antiviral activity compared to either AgNPs or chitosan alone [73] . AgNPs prevent transmissible gastroenteritis virus-induced apoptosis by regulating the p38/mitochondria-caspase-3 signaling pathway in swine testicle cells [74] . Curcumin-functionalized AgNPs demonstrated significant inhibitory effects against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection by decreasing viral titers about two-orders of magnitude to non-toxic concentrations in host cells. Further, AgNPs prevented RSV from infecting host cells by inactivating the virus directly [75] .AgNPs showed antiviral and preventive effects against H3N2 influenza virus infection. In the presence of AgNPs, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells infected with H3N2 influenza virus showed better viability and no obvious cytopathic effects compared to an influenza virus control group. Infected mice treated with AgNPs showed lower lung viral titers and minor pathologic lesions in lung tissue and longevity [76] . Graphene oxide (GO)-AgNPs, composed of two nanomaterials in a single platform, were more effective than either single agent. GO-AgNPs inhibited feline CoV (FCoV) infection by 25% and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) infection by 23%, whereas GO alone only inhibited FCoV 16% and showed no antiviral activity against IBDV [77] . Huy et al reported antiviral activity of AgNPs against influenza A, HBV, human parainfluenza, HSV and HIV [78] . AgNPs synthesized using a green chemistry ultra-sonication approach exhibited antiviral activity against influenza A [79] . Zanamivir-loaded AgNPs synergistically inhibited H1N1 influenza virus multiplication [80] . Tannic acid-modified AgNP-based muco-adhesive hydrogel effectively reduced HSV-2 infectivity at the vaginal mucosal surface [81] . AgNPs exhibited antiviral activity against human oncogenic \\u03b3-herpesviruses, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and Epstein-Barr virus by reactivating viral lytic replication through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autophagy [82] . Children are mostly affected by RSV; however, there is no specific treatment option available. The RSV virion contains two surface glycoproteins (F and G) that are vital for the initial phases of infection, making them critical targets for RSV treatment. AgNPs reduced RSV replication and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1\\u03b1, IL-6 and TNF-\\u03b1) and pro-inflammatory chemokines (i.e., CCL2, CCL3, CCL5). Mice treated intravaginally with tannic acid (TA)-mediated AgNPs showed better clinical scores and lower virus titers in the vaginal tissues. The TA-mediated AgNP-treated group also showed significantly increased percentages of IFN-gamma+ CD8+ T-cells, activated B cells and plasma cells, while the spleens contained significantly higher percentages of IFN-gamma+ NK cells and effector-memory CD8+ T cells compared to NaCl-treated group. Further, the AgNP-treated animals showed significantly better sera titers of anti-HSV-2 neutralization antibodies than the NaCl-treated animals [83] . AgNPs interaction with HIV-1 in size-dependent manner and that the bound particles exhibit regular spatial relationships. AgNPs undergo preferential binding with the gp120 subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein. These interaction between AgNPs and glycoproteins inhibit the virus from binding to host cells [84] and AgNPs act as potential antiviral agents against various type of viruses including influenza virus [85, 86] . Biologically synthesized AgNPs using plant extracts of Lampranthus coccineus and Malephora lutea exhibited significant antiviral activity against different types of viruses such as HSV-1, HAV-10 and CoxB4 virus [87] . Altogether, all these studies demonstrated that the antiviral potential of AgNPs.Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have also drawn great interest in industry and nanomedicine due to their excellent electrical, optical, mechanical and biological properties [88, 89] . AuNPs are used to detect DNA sequences, proteins, bacteria and viruses and they are frequently used in cancer studies and as antiviral and antibacterial agents. Gold nanorod, a GNR-5 PPP-ssRNA nanoplex-mediated immune activator, was reported to inhibit H1N1 influenza viral replication by upregulating the expression of IFN-\\u03b2 and other IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), resulting in decreased viral replication [90] . Hyaluronic acid AuNPs and IFN complex have been used for targeted treatment of hepatitis C (HCV) infection [91] and highly mono-dispersed quasi spherical AuNPs inhibit HSV. Compared with the clinical drug acyclovir, AuNPs are very safe; they do not induce any drug-resistant viral strains and exhibit excellent viricidal properties [92] . Functionalized AuNPs suppress influenza virus, HSV and HIV. AuNPs potentially increase antiviral effects through multivalent interactions; dendronized AuNPs inhibit HIV more effectively than dendrons alone [93, 94] . Sialic acid-functionalized AuNPs inhibit influenza virus infection, by multivalent interactions, relatively better than some synthetic clinical drugs such as zanamivir and oseltamivir, which are prone to resistance development by the influenza virus [95, 96] . A study was performed to investigate the effect of AuNPs on Schistosoma mansoni-infected mouse liver. Comparing the treated and untreated infected groups, AuNPs significantly decreased the activities of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide and increased the level of glutathione (GSH). Concomitantly, AuNPs ameliorated the inflammatory response by decreasing the mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1\\u03b2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\\u03b1, IFN-\\u03b3 and inducible nitric oxide synthase [97] . AuNPs also inhibited attachment and penetration of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) at the early stages of infection and impaired viral replication at later stages at non-toxic concentrations and at early stage [47] . AuNPs conjugated with peptide triazoles (AuNP-PT) exhibited significant antiviral effects against HIV-1 compared to the corresponding peptide triazoles alone. The enhanced virolytic activity and corresponding irreversible HIV-1 inactivation by AuNP-PT is due to multivalent contact between the nanoconjugates and metastable envelope spike (S) proteins on the HIV-1 virus [98] . Conjugation of M2e peptide with AuNPs and CpG as a soluble adjuvant (AuNP-M2e + sCpG) induced lung B cell activation and a robust serum anti-M2e immunoglobulin G (IgG) response in mice. Antibodies generated in response to the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) are capable of binding to the homotetrameric form of M2 expressed on infected cells [99] . Nanoparticles functionalized with the FluPep ligand showed enhanced antiviral activity compared to the free peptides. Conjugation of FluPep to AuNPs and AgNPs enhanced antiviral potency [100] . Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), composed of tens and hundreds of gold atoms with an average size of 1-2 nm, play critical roles in biomedicine. Bai et al. (2018) reported that AuNCs prevented entry of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) into host cells [101] . AuNCs selectively inhibited the proliferation and protein expression of PRRSV. Surface modification plays an important role in the antiviral activity of AuNCs; therefore, researchers modified the surface of AuNCs with two different materials-histidine and mercaptoethane sulfonate. Among these, histidine-stabilized AuNCs showed strong inhibition of Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1645 8 of 29 the proliferation of pseudorabies virus (PRV) [101, 102] . Therefore, AuNPs functionalized with different molecules play critical roles in antiviral activity.Quantum dots (QDs) are nanocrystals of a semiconducting materials with an average size between 2-10 nm and these are widely used in cell labeling, detection and image tracking with particular size-dependent optical and electronic properties includes carbon, silver, gold, CdSeS/ZnS and so on [103] . However, the uses of QD as an antiviral agent are very limited. Du et al developed GSH-capped cadmium telluride (Cd)Te QDs and demonstrated that they altered the structure of PRV surface proteins inhibiting the virus from entering the host cells [104] . Furthermore, the binding of CdTe QDs to the cell membrane itself also decreased viral numbers. Antiviral effects of stable carbon dots (CDots) with low toxicity were studied with PRV and PRRSV as test models of DNA and RNA viruses, respectively. CDots significantly inhibited the multiplication of both PRV and PRRSV. Furthermore, CDots remarkably induced the production of endogenous IFN and the expression of ISGs, which are responsible for virus replication [105, 106] . The effect of various surface functionalizations of CDots was studied using 2,2 -(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) (EDA) and 3-ethoxypropylamine (EPA) against human norovirus virus-like-particles (VLPs), GI.1 and GII.4. Both EDA-and EPA-CDots (5 \\u00b5g/mL each) were highly effective in inhibiting the binding of both strains of VLPs to histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) receptors on human cells. EDA-CDots achieved 100% inhibition and EPA CDots achieved 85-99% inhibition [107] .Benzoxazine monomer-derived CDots inhibited the infectivity of flaviviruses and non-enveloped viruses such as porcine parvovirus and adenovirus-associated virus by directly binding to the surface of virions and inhibiting the first step of virus and host cell interaction [108] . Cdots, surface-functionalized with boronic acid or an amine, inhibited the entry of HSV-1 into host cells by way of the alteration of viral coat proteins [109] . The use of biomolecules to prepare CDots provides stable and biocompatible materials. The antiviral effect of curcumin-stabilized cationic carbon dots (CCM-CDots) was evaluated against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) as a CoV model; CCM-CDots were found to inhibit the proliferation of PEDV with much higher efficiency than non-CCM-CDots [105] . CCM-CDots work by changing the viral surface protein structure, suppressing the synthesis of virus negative-strand RNA and virus budding and then inhibiting viral entry by generation of ROS, thus stimulating the production of ISGs and proinflammatory cytokines [105] . Carbon quantum dots (CQDs), derived from hydrothermal carbonization of ethylenediamine/citric acid, inhibited the entry and replication of HCoV-229E by interaction of the functional groups of the CQDs with HCoV-229E entry receptors on the host cell membrane [110] . Curcumin-mediated CQDs (Cur-CQDs) were prepared in a one-step heating process and injected with enterovirus 71 (EV71) in new-born mice. These Cur-CQDs exhibited superior antiviral effects [111] . Similarly, biocompatible CQDs prepared using glycyrrhizic acid (Gly-CDs) inhibited the proliferation of PRRSV by up to five-orders of viral titer [112] . Gly-CDs inhibited PRRSV invasion and replication, stimulated antiviral innate immune responses and suppressed the accumulation of intracellular ROS caused by PRRSV infection. Surface charge of the functionalized materials play critical role in the interactions between positively charged CDots and the negatively charged VLPs Positively charged EDA-CDots exhibited a higher inhibitory effect (~82%) than non-charged EPA-CDots (~60%) [107] . Both types of CDots also exhibited inhibitory effects on the binding of VLPs to their respective antibodies but they were much less effective in blocking the binding to HBGA receptors. After CDot treatment, VLPs remained intact and no degradation of the VLP capsid proteins was observed [107] . To summarize, the observed antiviral effects of CDots on noroviruses were mainly through effective inhibition of VLP binding to HBGA receptors and moderate inhibition of antibody binding, without affecting the integrity of the viral capsid protein and the viral particle. Collectively, QDs play critical roles in inhibiting various types of viruses.Graphene oxide (GO) is a unique single-atom-thick and two-dimensional carbon material arranged in a hexagonal lattice. GO and its derivatives are of immense interest to nanomedicine researchers due to their remarkable electronic, mechanical and thermal properties [113] . GO is widely used as an antibacterial and anticancer agent [114] . GO act as antiviral agent through inactivation of the pathogenic agent of hand-foot-and-mouth disease, EV71 and endemic gastrointestinal avian influenza A virus H9N2 [115] . Nanocomposites consisting of GO and partially reduced sulfonated GO (rGO-SO 3 ) composite showed antiviral activity against HSV-1 by inhibiting HSV-1 from attaching to host cells [116] . The antiviral activity of GO and reduced GO was evaluated against PRV (a DNA virus) and PEDV (an RNA virus) revealing that GO significantly suppressed the infection of PRV and PEDV by a 2-log reduction in virus titers at non-cytotoxic concentrations. GO inhibited viral entry into the host cells by structural destruction [117] . Nanocomposites consisting of GO and AgNPs showed potential antiviral activity against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, for example, FCoV and IBDV, respectively. Viral inhibition assays demonstrated that GO-AgNPs inhibited FCoV infection by 25% and IBDV by 23%, whereas GO alone only inhibited FCoV infection by 16% but showed no antiviral activity against IBDV infection. Therefore, the combination of GO and AgNPs exhibited better antiviral activity compared to either GO or silver alone [77] . Curcumin-Loaded GO exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on RSV infection with significant biocompatibility. GO inactivates directly by inhibiting the virus from attaching to host cells and considered to be coupled with prophylactic and therapeutic effects on the virus. The combination of GO and curcumin was more effective than either single agent against RSV infection [118] . Iannazzo et al. (2018) reported that the conjugation of GO and QDs (GQDs) potentially inhibited the replication of HIV [119] . Hypericin (HY)-loaded GO protected against novel duck reovirus (NDRV) disease, which is a serious infectious disease of poultry. The antiviral activity of the complex (GO/HY) was studied in DF-1 cells and in ducklings infected with NDRV TH11 strain. GO/HY showed a dose-dependent inhibition of NDRV replication, which may be attributed to direct virus inactivation or inhibition of virus attachment [120] .Zinc oxide nanoparticles is a type of metal nanoparticles exhibited significant microbial activity against various type of microorganisms including viruses. The antiviral activity of zinc oxide (ZnO) micro-nano structures (MNSs) ZnO-MNSs was evaluated in virus infected corneal tissues. Partially negatively charged zinc oxide ZnO-MNSs efficiently trap the virions via a novel virostatic mechanism rendering them unable to enter into human corneal fibroblasts-a natural target cell for HSV-1 infection. Zinc oxide tetrapods (ZnOTs) significantly block the entry of Herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) into target cells and also stop the spread of the virus. The ZnOTs exhibit the antiviral activity by the ability to neutralize HSV-2 virions that natural target cells such as human vaginal epithelial and HeLa cells showed highly reduced infectivity when infected with HSV-2 virions [121] . Zinc oxide tetrapod nanoparticles (ZOTEN) induce immune system against HSV-2 virus and provide the therapeutic effects [122] . Zinc oxide tetrapods inhibit herpes simplex virus infection of cultured corneas [123] . The antiviral effect of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated ZnO-NPs (ZnO-PEG-NPs) on herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated ZnO-NPs with concentration of 200 \\u00b5g/ml inhibits at the rate of approximately 92% in copy number of HSV-1 genomic DNA and also it reduces virus titer [124] . Surface modified zinc oxide nanoparticles could modify the infection potential of HSV-1 via neutralizing the virus rather than through interfering with cellular targets by electrostatic interference of H-ZNPs with virus rather than the hydrophobic interaction ZNPs with virus [125] . Ghaffari et al. (2019) determined the antiviral activity of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) and PEGylated zinc oxide nanoparticles against H1N1 influenza virus [126] . The findings suggest that post-exposure of influenza virus with PEGylated ZnO-NPs and bare ZnO-NPs at the highest non-toxic concentrations could be led to 2.8 and 1.2 log10 TCID50 reduction in virus titer when compared to the virus control. The inhibition rate was much better in PEGylated ZNPs compared to unPEGylated ZnO-NPs. Zn 2+ ions potentially inhibited Nidovirus replication and increasing concentration of the intracellular Zn 2+ concentration can efficiently impair the replication of a variety of RNA viruses [127] . Prior incubation of HSV-2 with zinc oxide tetrapod nanoparticles (ZOTEN) inhibits the ability of the virus to infect vaginal tissue in female Balb/c mice and blocks virus shedding through neutralizing of virions particles in the host cells and also it stimulate a local immune response [128] .Organic nanoparticles are widely used for drug delivery and therapeutic purposes in humans due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability and easy surface modification. The most common organic nanoparticles are polymeric nanoparticles, which are colloidal solids ranging from 10 to 1000 nm in diameter. The small size can facilitate capillary penetration and uptake by cells resulting in increased concentrations at target sites [129] . Polyhexylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles are loaded with either the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir (Ro 31-8959) or the nucleoside analog zalcitabine (2 ,3 -dideoxycytidine). Both nanoparticulate formulations led to a dose-dependent reduction of HIV-1 antigen production. Nanoparticles as a drug carrier system improved the delivery of antiviral agents to the mononuclear phagocyte system in vivo, overcoming pharmacokinetic problems and enhancing the activities of drugs for the treatment of HIV infection and AIDS [130] . Acyclovir loaded into beta-cyclodextrin-poly(4-acryloylmorpholine) (\\u03b2-CD-PACM) nanoparticles exhibited significant antiviral activity against two clinical isolates of HSV-1 compared to both the free drug and a soluble \\u03b2-CD-PACM complex [131] . 3D8 scFv-loaded PLGA (3D8-PLGA) NPs, potentially entered into the cytosolic regions of viral infected cells, were released continuously and hydrolyzed RNAs in the cytoplasm, thereby exhibiting maximal antiviral activity [132] . Diphyllin, a vacuolar ATPase blocker delivered by polymeric nanoparticles consisting of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PEG-PLGA), was more effective in inhibiting feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), caused by a mutated feline CoV, compared to diphyllin alone. Additionally, mice were more tolerant toward diphyllin-loaded nanoparticles. Therefore, nanoformulation with polymeric nanoparticles yielded potential antiviral activity against FIP [133] .The entry of viruses into host cells is complex and the process of interaction between the virus and host cell typically involves specific protein receptors. For example, multivalent flexible nanogels exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral activity by blocking virus entry and infection [134] . Previously, several studies used nanospheres for the treatment of HSV, HBV and influenza [135] [136] [137] [138] . Altogether, organic nanoparticles can serve as drug delivery agents against various types of viral diseases.Dendrimers are highly branched, symmetrical, macromolecular and hyper-branched structures radiating from a central core via connectors and branching units. Terminal groups are essential for targeting and interactions. Dendrimers are globular and contain three different regions-central core, branches and terminal functional groups. The potential functionality of dendrimers is due to encapsulation of several chemical moieties, interior layers and multiple surface groups [139] . In a study performed to determine the effect of various dendrimers on HSV-1/2, dendrimers BRI-2999 and BRI-6741 showed significant reduction of infection rates [140] . Two different type of peptide-derivatized dendrimers such as SB105 and SB105 A10 completely inhibited human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication and also inhibited murine CMV replication, whereas they were not able to inhibit adenovirus or vesicular stomatitis virus. The mechanism of inhibition of peptide-derivatized dendrimers namely SB105_A10 bound to human cells through an interaction with cell surface heparan sulfate and thereby blocked virion attachment to target cells [141] . Mice infected with Japanese encephalitis (JEV, GP78 strain) were administered with Morpholinos (5 mg/kg body weight) via intraperitoneal injection. Administration of Vivo-Morpholinos efficiently increased survival of animals and neuroprotection in a murine model of JEV [142] . SPL7013 is a dendrimer with broad-spectrum activity against HIV-1/2, HSV-1/2 and human papillomavirus. SPL7013 increased viricidal activity against HIV-1 strains that utilize the CXCR4 co-receptor [143] . Jyothi et al. (2015) developed novel liver-targeted cyclosporine A-encapsulated poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles that inhibited the replication of HCV both in vitro and in vivo [144] . A liver-specific sustained drug delivery system, generated by conjugating a liver-targeting peptide to PEGylated CsA-encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles, reduced the immunosuppressive effects and toxicity profile of host factor cyclophilin A, which is essential for HCV replication [144] .To reduce the development of resistance by viral mutations, a study was performed with newly designed and efficient entry inhibitors. Antiviral activity dendrimers, as well as fullerene C 60 -with a unique symmetrical and 3D globular structure-were evaluated against an Ebola pseudotyped infection model. The central alkyne scaffold of fullerene connected to 12 sugar-containing [59] fullerene units (total 120 mannoses)-exhibited outstanding antiviral activity with an IC 50 in the sub-nanomolar range [145] . The low concentration of camptothecin-loaded dendrimers inhibited HCV replication with very low toxicity. The triple combination of carbosilane dendrimers, tenofovir and maraviroc showed potential for inhibiting HIV sexual transmission [130, 131, 146] . Polyanionic dendrimers comprising the terminal groups sodium carboxylate, hydroxyl and succinamic acid and polycationic dendrimers containing primary amines were used to assess their antiviral activity in MERS-CoV plaque inhibition assays. The hydroxyl polyanionic set showed a 17.36-29.75% decrease in MERS-CoV plaque formation. All of these dendrimers showed excellent antiviral activity against MERS-CoV [147] . The unique properties of dendrimers are due to the presence of numerous surface functional groups, which facilitate conjugation with multiple drugs or targeting ligands. They also have the ability to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs due to their limited cavity size. VivaGel is a G4-poly-L-lysine dendrimer formed from the divalent benzhydylamine amide of L-lysine and it contains 32 terminal anionic functional groups used as an effective antiviral agent [148] .Polymers have high antiviral capacity due to their long chains and branches and their flexible molecular design. Polymers can be designed as arbitrary standards based on viricidal effects. They can be used not only as effective antiviral drugs but also as co-factors for treatment of viral infectious diseases. Polymers carrying antiviral drugs efficiently increase the solubility of antiviral drugs, thus prolonging the retention time and enhancing the uptake efficiency of drugs into cells. For example, organotin compounds were prepared according to the needs of universal viral agents [149] . Organotin and cisplatin-like polymers effectively kill viruses by inhibiting viral replication [150] . The polymers consist of poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE)-based cationic conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPE) and oligo-phenylene ethynylenes (OPE). They act as antiviral agents by the mechanism of oxidative stress, producing singlet oxygen species due to the \\u03c0 bonding system in the backbone of the compound upon exposure to UV-visible light. The oxidative stress induces damage to macromolecules including DNA, RNA and proteins [151] . Nucleic acid polymers containing hepatitis B surface antigen have been used to treat hepatitis D infection by binding to the amphipathic alpha helix in the class I surface glycoprotein [152] . Polymeric nanogels, which are cross-linked hydrogel particles comprising water-soluble and expandable polymers, are easily degradable into smaller sized fragments removed by renal clearance. These polymers can prevent the entry of virus particles into host cells by attaching to the heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the host cell surface. These flexible nanogels serve as robust inhibitors of HSV-2 virus infections [134] . Chun et al. (2018) designed amphiphilic copolymers comprising methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-block poly(phenylalanine), which consist of encapsulated mir-323a in the core and favipiravir in the exterior layer as both hydrophilic and hydrophobic antiviral agents [153] . These polymer-carried drugs serve to treat influenza A virus infectious diseases significantly better than naked drug delivery systems without polymers. The specific advantages of polymers are the sustained release of antiviral agents and the improved metabolic stability of the integrated drug. These properties demonstrate the great potential of polymeric particles for the successful delivery of antiviral agents [45] . Nanoviricide is a nanomachine that is armed to destroy a particular kind of virus using various types of nanoparticles. For example, polymeric nanoparticles were used to inhibit Varicella Zoster Virus infection in human skin and also polymeric nanoparticles were used for targeted drug delivery to prevent virus spreading and infections.Liposomes are spherical in shape with an average size of 20 to 30 nm and are composed of a phospholipid bilayer containing an aqueous core [154] . Hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs can be incorporated into the inner aqueous cavity or the phospholipid bilayer, respectively. Liposomes are non-toxic and biocompatible. When the HIV virus envelop region T cell receptor targeted antisense RNA was encapsulated in liposomes, HIV-1 production was completely inhibited [155] . Hematopoietic toxicity and antiviral activity of liposomal-encapsulated 3 -azido-3 -deoxythymidine (AZT) were examined in mice for 5 days following intravenous administration (0.4 to 10 mg/kg body weight); a significantly depressed bone marrow cellularity as well as a corresponding decrease in red blood cells, blood neutrophils and monocyte numbers were observed. Treatment with liposomal AZT significantly reduced virus proliferation using AZT alone [156] . Nanocarbon fullerene lipidosome (NCFL) inhibited influenza virus H1N1 by a direct killing effect, which was comparable to that of rimantadine hydrochloride [157] . To develop broad-spectrum antiviral agents against a variety of viral infections, polyunsaturated liposomes (PLs) were fabricated for use in in vivo drug delivery and to specifically target the endoplasmic reticulum. These PLs contained polyunsaturated fatty acids that exhibit independent antiviral activity by reducing cellular cholesterol. Targeting cholesterol biosynthesis within infected cells is one of the promising targets of many viral systems, including HCV, HBV and HIV [158] . PLs significantly decreased viral infectivity and secretion in HCV, HBV and HIV infections. Pretreatment of cells with PLs reduced the infectivity of both HCV and HIV by suppressing plasma membrane cholesterol levels. Cationic liposomes, containing both a fluorescence marker (calcein) and antiviral drugs HPMPC (Cidofovir \\u00ae ), were internalized in MDBK cells infected with bovine HSV-1 and significantly inhibited viral replication [159] . Norovirus RdRp is used as an antiviral agent and it is a promising target enzyme for the development of new antiviral drugs. The polysulfonated naphthylurea suramin has the potential to inhibit murine and human norovirus polymerases. Suramin-loaded liposomes exhibited significant antiviral activity against murine norovirus cultivated in RAW 264.7 macrophages [160] . Furthermore, surmamin inhibited the replication of various chikungunya viral (CHIKV) isolates including Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus. Various studies revealed that the antiviral activity and mechanism of suramin is through interference with (re)initiation of RNA synthesis. The antiviral effect of suramin-containing liposomes potentially prevents and helps treat CHIKV infections [161] . Acyclovir-Loaded flexible membrane vesicles showed significant antiviral activity in a murine model of cutaneous HSV-1 infection. The lipid based system exhibited safe treatment [162] . Cationic liposomes loaded with stearylamine (SA) inhibited viral infectivity without preloaded active pharmaceutical ingredients. SA liposomes suppressed baculoviral infectivity in several mammalian cell lines, including A549 cells. The SA liposomes are non-toxic and could increase antiviral effects by reducing cholesterol content, which intensify concurrently with increased binding of SA liposomes to the cell membrane. SA liposomes potentiate the entry of virus particles into host cells and are compatible with the antiviral drug acyclovir [163] . Hence, liposomes are the best carrier molecules to deliver antiviral drugs.Antiviral mechanisms of nanoparticles should target attachment, penetration, replication and budding of viruses. Possible mechanisms involve inactivation of the virus directly or indirectly, prevention of attachment of viruses to host cells and blocking viral replication but they also depend on the form and type of nanoparticles used [57] . Most often, nanoparticles block the above steps by altering the structure of the capsid protein and eventually reducing virulence, which can be attributed to both physical and chemical means of decreasing the active viral load. For example, Lara et al. (2010) demonstrated that AgNPs bind to glycoprotein gp120 of the HIV envelope preventing CD4-dependent virion binding, fusion and infectivity in cell-free and cell-associated viral assays [53, 164] . Recently, Cagno et al. demonstrated the antiviral mechanisms of broad-spectrum, non-toxic nanoparticles against HSV, human papilloma virus, RSV, dengue and lenti virus [165] . The authors showed that a series of antiviral nanoparticles with long and flexible linkers mimicking heparin sulfate proteoglycans, the highly conserved target of viral attachment ligands (VALs), could achieve efficient viral prevention. This was through effective viral association with binding simulated to be strong and multivalent to the VAL repeating units [165] . Water-Soluble fullerene-polyglycerol sulfates prevented interaction of vesicular stomatitis virus coat glycoprotein with baby hamster kidney cells [166] . Lysenko et al. (2018) proposed that one of the main and direct mechanisms of nanoparticle-mediated antiviral activity is linked to local-field action against the receptors at the virus surface [50] . In this process, the nanoparticles adsorbed on the surface of the cell can greatly alter the membrane potential. On the other hand, the indirect antiviral mechanism of nanoparticles includes blocking the penetration of the virus into the cell due to a change in membrane potential. Collectively, these reports suggest that the main mechanisms of nanoparticle antiviral activity involve interaction with gp120, competitive binding between the virus and nanoparticles for the host cell, interference with viral attachment, inhibition of virus-host cell binding and penetration, binding to the plasma membrane, inactivation of viral particles prior to entry and interaction with double-stranded DNA and/or binding with viral particles [96, 135, 164, [167] [168] [169] [170] . While metal nanoparticles interact with viral particles, replication of the virus is blocked (Figure 3 ). and/or binding with viral particles [96, 135, 164, [167] [168] [169] [170] . While metal nanoparticles interact with viral particles, replication of the virus is blocked (Figure 3) .Recently, Cagno et al. [165] demonstrated the state of the art mechanism of non-toxic nanoparticles against various type of viruses. The authors developed antiviral products, which usually mimic heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), as well-preserved target of \\\"viral attachment ligands\\\" (VALs). The antiviral effect relies on the binding mechanism of the nanoparticles to the virus surface, thus preventing virus-cell attachment. The most outstanding viricidal effect was found in the AuNPs coated with a 2:1 mixture of decanesulfonic acid (MUS) and 1-octanethiol (OT). MUS allows a multivalent binding as a consequence of its structure comprising a long hydrophobic chain, sulfonic acid terminated. The enhanced activity of MUS:OT-NPs was assigned to the new construct using MUS linker that caused local distortions and then a global virus deformation, leading to irreversible loss of infectivity. The MUS:OT-NPs exhibited efficient virucidal effect against HSV-1 and HSV-2, human papilloma virus (HPV-16), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), dengue and lenti virus. The synthesized MUS:OT-NPs exhibited toxic to the virus and non-toxic to the host cells [165] .The possible mechanism of antiviral activity of non-toxic nanoparticles such as gold inhibits viral replication and prevent release of viral particles into the host cells. The inhibition can take place by nanoparticles act as blockers of neuraminidase enzyme which cleaves the attachment between hemagglutinin on the progeny virus and sialic acid receptor on the host cell. In this case, nanoparticles prevent this cleavage step and interfere with the release of progeny virus from infected host cells and subsequently, prevent the progression of infection. Therefore, the possible antiviral mechanism could be inhibition of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities. In addition, like gold nanoparticles blocking attachment of virus into the host cells.

Therefore, the possible antiviral mechanism could be inhibition of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities. In addition, like gold nanoparticles blocking attachment of virus into the host cells.Over the last decade, nanoscience and nanotechnology have played a critical role in nanomedicine due to the size, shape and surface charge of nanoparticles as carriers, detection agents and direct inhibitory agents against microbes and cancer cells. Nanoparticles have been shown to be efficient and selective agents for the delivery of therapeutic moieties such as drugs, vaccines, siRNAs and peptides. In addition, nanoparticles have been used to detect and monitor diseases and treat responses using noninvasive imaging modalities. The size of nanomaterials facilitates their involvement in the efficient delivery of antigens due to surface functionalization; they have the capability of co-transporting antigens accompanied by numerous adjuvants. Nanomaterials are able to deliver the drug at suitable concentrations in a precise manner, to the proper place and at the proper time [171] .An important aspect of nanomaterials in relation to CoVs, is that they are able to inhibit or compete with viral binding to the host cell-surface receptor. For example, the ACE2 receptor plays a critical role in the entry of CoVs into host cells, especially in the case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [172] . Hence, blocking and/or decreasing the levels of ACE2 could help in the fight against infection, as well as in the development of antibodies against ACE2. On the other hand, ACE2 has a protective effect against virus-induced lung injury after infection as a result of increasing the production of the vasodilator angiotensin 1-7 [173] . Therefore, preventing COVID-19 in the host can be more effective than fighting against the virus after infection. Instead of developing vaccines, which typically takes a long time and several rounds of protocols and trials, it would be better to try to prevent entry of these viruses into humans using nanotechnology for preparing masks, clothes, gloves and gums by exploiting ACE2-coated nanoflowers and QDs [174] . In addition, researchers have demonstrated that nanoflowers and ACE2-coated QDs can be used as bio-detection probes. Furthermore, they have been used to enhance catalytic activity and stability of ACE2 and also to produce chewing gums, nose filters, masks, clothes and gloves to prevent entry and spread of CoVs [174, 175] . Therefore, if materials used in hospitals were prepared with coated nanoparticles, the spread of CoV infection may be inhibited. Herein, we propose a hypothetical antiviral mechanism involving ACE2-coated nanoflowers and ACE2-coated QDs that could block SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells by inhibiting attachment of the virus to the ACE2 protein, while also inhibiting activation of the accessory serine protease TMPRSS2 (Figure 4) .A nanoparticle-based intranasal delivery system is an effective and safe tool to deliver several therapeutic moieties such as vaccines, drugs, siRNAs, peptides and antibodies. Intranasal delivery is noninvasive, practical, simple and cost effective. The intranasal delivery system has been evaluated for vaccination against respiratory viruses such as influenza and CoVs [176, 177] . Nanoparticle-Mediated delivery systems have the following benefits-free from enzyme degradation; long-term existence, release and retention within the system; amicable co-delivery with adjuvants; specific targeting of cells through receptor-ligand interactions; and potentiation of the immune system [178, 179] . may be inhibited. Herein, we propose a hypothetical antiviral mechanism involving ACE2-coated nanoflowers and ACE2-coated QDs that could block SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells by inhibiting attachment of the virus to the ACE2 protein, while also inhibiting activation of the accessory serine protease TMPRSS2 (Figure 4) . There are major challenges in combatting infectious diseases such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, including the fact that there are no effective drugs or vaccines available. Bachmann and Jennings (2010) reported that nanoparticles have the potential to enhance transport in the lymphatic system compared to smaller subunit antigens. Virus-Like nanoparticles (VLNPs) play a significant role in vaccine development as vaccine carriers and they can stimulate host-immune responses [180] . Nanoparticle-based vaccines have shown much promise in improving vaccine efficacy, immunization strategies and targeted delivery. VLNPs improve vaccine efficacy, protect the antigens from premature proteolytic degradation, facilitate antigen uptake, control release and they are non-toxic [181] . VLNPs are composed of a self-assembled viral membrane that forms a monomeric complex displaying a high density of epitopes [182] . VLNPs can accommodate the expression of additional proteins or the endogenous expression of multiple antigens [183, 184] . Due to these specific features and unique qualities, VLNPs can provide protection not only against viruses but also against heterologous antigens [185] . A host-immune response was generated after the delivery of an antigen using virus capsid protein SV40 in mammalian cells [186] . VLNPs can increase the immunogenicity of weak antigens including Salmonella typhi membrane antigen and influenza A M2 protein. VLNPs containing H1V1 Nef gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) assembled and produced a strong antigen-specific humoral response as well as a cellular immune response [187, 188] . VLNPs seem to be better carrier molecules, owing to their multiple surface antigens, compared to antigen presenting cells, which can only present one type of antigen on their surface [189] . Another interesting feature of VLNPs is their high surface energy, which leads to strong adhesion of biomolecules. These qualities contribute to a virus mimicking effect that stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies and immune cells to fight viral infections [190, 191] . The combination of AuNPs (with an average size of 100 nm) and spike (S) proteins of infectious bronchitis virus exhibited increased stability when used to developed VLNPs and showed a significant retention of the S proteins compared to viral antigens [192] . VLNPs mediated the inhibitory effects of MERS-CoV S protein nanoparticle vaccine and matrix (M1) protein adjuvant combination on MERS-CoV replication in the lungs of mice. In addition, the MERS-CoV S nanoparticle vaccine produced a high titer of anti-S neutralizing antibodies and protected against MERS-CoV infection in mice in vivo. Altogether, these studies suggest that VLNPs conjugated with S protein seem to be a potential design for a successful vaccine, not only to stimulate the immune system but also to protect humans from MERS-CoV. This approach can also be applied to SARS-CoV-2 as both CoVs use the same mechanism of entry into host cells and similar pathogenicity [193] . Taken together, nanoparticles can be used as antiviral agents against various types of viruses including SARS-CoV-2.Emerging and reemerging viruses are responsible for a number of recent epidemic outbreaks. A vital part of controlling of viruses are predicting and controlling of spreading and infections. Although we are developing various kinds of antiviral drugs to stop spreading and infections of deadly viruses, the detection of pathogen is very critical in the first place. Therefore, researchers are interested to develop sensitive, rapid, simple technique for accurate characterization of emerging virus strains. Manual magnetic particle-based extraction methods were developed to detect HIV and HCV viral nucleic acids combination with detection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) one-step. These methods can be used to routinely screen blood donation for viremic donors [194] . Liu et al. (2013) developed a rapid diagnostic platform for pathogen detection based on the acetylcholinesterase-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction which is comparable to that of PCR and easily detectable through changing of color [195] . Silica-Coated magnetic nanoparticles were prepared by co-precipitation method. These Fe 3 O 4 /SiO 2 nanoparticles were used to isolate genomic DNA of hepatitis virus type B (HBV) and of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) for detection of the viruses based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results depicted that the purification efficiency of DNA of both HBV and EBV using obtained Fe 3 O 4 /SiO 2 nanoparticles was significantly better that commercially available reagents [196] . Yeh et al. (2020) developed a portable microfluidic platform containing carbon nanotube arrays with differential filtration porosity for the rapid enrichment and optical identification of viruses [197] . This technique used to characterize various type of viruses including rhinovirus, influenza virus and parainfluenza viruses. This enrichment method could be used to rapidly track and monitor viral outbreaks in real time. Zhao et al. (2020) developed efficient magnetic nanoparticles-based viral RNA extraction method to detect SARS-CoV-2, which is comparable with PCR techniques [198] .Recently, SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a global threat for both healthcare and the economy. Currently, a variety of antiviral agents, including re-purposed drugs, are under testing in clinical trials to assess their efficacy against this new virus but the mission of finding an effective treatment for COVID-19 is ongoing [199] [200] [201] [202] . Previously, several modes of treatment were practiced against MERS and SARS infections including the use of inhibitors of viral and host proteases, IFNs and host-directed therapies. Ribavirin, a nucleoside analog that acts as an RNA polymerase inhibitor was used on patients with SARS and MERS [203, 204] . Development of new therapies should focus on the CoV S protein because it guides the entry of CoVs into host cells by participating in the binding and fusion of the virus to the ACE2 receptor on the host cell membrane. The S protein is composed of two subunits-S1 recognizes and binds to host receptors and S2 facilitates fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane [205] . Although several agents have been developed using peptide fusion inhibitors, anti-CoV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and entry receptor antagonists, none of these potentially curative agents is approved for commercial use in humans [206] . Remdesivir, an adenosine analogue, is a broad-spectrum antiviral with potent in vitro efficacy against multiple genetically-unrelated RNA viruses including Ebola, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [38] . Remdesivir seems to be an effective antiviral agent against COVID-19 [207] . Another drug, chloroquine, has an immunomodulatory effect and functions at both the entry-and post-entry stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection [208] . However, all of these agents have undesired side effects. Therefore, other agents such as nanoparticles need to be explored as alternative antiviral agents.Recently, nano and nanomediated combination therapy (nanoparticles plus antiviral drugs) have shown immense promise in nanomedicine. Metal nanoparticles and metal-loaded nanocomposites are known to be extremely effective against microbes and viruses due to their unique property, the controlled release of ions. For example, the controlled release of ionic copper is the fundamental aspect for the antimicrobial and antiviral properties of surfaces [209] . In addition, the controlled release of ions favors the production of ROS. Metal-grafted GO decorated with metals such as Ag, Fe, Cu, Zn, TiO2, CdS and MnS 2 exhibited potential antiviral activity [77, 210] . For example, silver and copper decorated GOs are potential antiviral agents for both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses [77] . The development of nanomaterial-mediated therapy is an alternative to conventional therapies in fighting against resistant viruses [211] . AgNPs are able to interact with host receptors and inhibit viral entry. Functionalized AuNPs showed antiviral activity against HIV-1 and also against H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 [211] .Adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2)-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) is a key regulator of endocytosis. Hence, a drug such as baricitinib that inhibits AAK1 may suppress viral entry into target cells. As such, baricitinib could be a potential treatment for COVID-19 [212] . Baricitinib has been shown to bind to another endocytosis regulator, cyclin G-associated kinase and inhibit AAK1, thus preventing viral entry into the cell [213] . HIV protease inhibitors such as lopinavir and ritonavirin suppress 3-chymotrypsin-like protease activity of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [214] . Remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue that targets RdRp, suppresses viral RNA synthesis in a broad spectrum of RNA viruses including HCoVs. Remdesivir inhibited RdRp of CoVs in cell cultures and animal models [201, 215] . A combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin can potentially increase the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Chloroquine-Based drugs inhibit the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 with host cells by acidifying the lysosomes and thus inhibiting cathepsins that require a low pH for optimal cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. These drugs can also alter cross-talk between SARS-CoV-2 and host cells and reduce production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while activating anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cells [216, 217] .Infectious diseases cause immense global mortality and viruses are responsible for about one-third of these deaths. Respiratory infections are among the most common causes of death worldwide, especially due to CoVs. Presently, the outbreak of viral respiratory infections, particularly COVID-19, is widespread and continuing to spread worldwide. As of 27 July 2020, SARS-CoV-2, the infectious agent of COVID-19, had infected 16,430,566 individuals and led to the death of more than 652,434 individuals in 215 countries, while also triggering an exceptional economic crisis. Although there are no specific drugs or vaccines to treat or prevent COVID-19, the available antiviral drugs are re-purposed drugs and active against a limited panel of human pathogens. Therefore, researchers are urgently striving to identify and develop suitable nano-based drugs and nano-vaccines, in addition to conventional approaches. Nanotechnology plays a critical role in both viral disease diagnosis and therapeutics. Nanoparticles show great potential for biomedical applications, especially in patients who relapse after completing conventional antiviral therapy. Antiviral resistance, which is a slowly developing problem of conventional therapeutic approaches, may be addressed using nanoparticles due to their large surface-to-volume ratio, surface charge, size and shape as well as their optical, electronic, biological and functional properties. Furthermore, nano-based approaches are feasible, cost effective, non-toxic, biocompatible and a convenient strategy to deal with various types of viral infections, particularly SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. In this review, we have provided a brief account of the main mechanism of entry of viruses into host cells. We also discussed in detail the effects of several important types of nanomaterials including AgNPs, AuNPs, QDs, organic nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers and polymers against various types of viral infections. These functional nanoparticles can provide a novel platform for fabrication of bio-safe and effective drugs for nanoscale treatment of viral infectious diseases. Further, we discussed antiviral mechanisms, therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles and the effects of nanoparticles on CoVs. Finally, we provide our future perspective of nanoparticles below.Nanotechnology has become a focal point of research and various types of nanomaterials have been explored and evaluated for their prophylactic and therapeutic activity against different viruses. Therefore, nanoparticle-based therapy seems to be promising but there are still many challenges and barriers to achieve its full potential. The future focus of antiviral nano-based therapy should concentrate on development of new antiviral therapeutics and approaches to challenge the emergence of drug resistance and different secondary effects due to long-term conventional treatments. Antiviral drugs currently available are effective against a few viral diseases such as influenza, hepatitis, HSV and HIV. Generally, development of an antiviral drug takes a long time (years) and the process involves tedious protocols, particularly for CoVs due to their variability. Most of the antiviral drugs developed through nanoparticle research show immense potential in in vitro and in vivo conditions; however, several variables need to be optimized for a successful translation of nanomaterials from the laboratory to the clinical setting. In addition, one important aspect is the non-toxic nature of nanoparticles, which require long and intense studies to demonstrate their non-toxic nature, let alone their potential activity against specific viruses. The biotech/nanotech industry needs more exposure to demonstrate the effects of nanoparticles on health and their applications in various fields. The crucial points and future focus of nano-based antiviral drugs need to be on the following important issues. First, the system needs to have receptor-based nanoparticles, which could be safely managed as antiviral agents to rapidly target specific viruses. Second, functionalization by specific molecules is needed to facilitate effective targeting of specific sites of viral infections. Third, non-or reduced-toxicity must remain a priority; biocompatibility with no undesired side effects is essential. Fourth, a therapeutic approach that combines nanoparticles and low concentrations of antiviral drugs with excellent efficiency, is needed. Finally, a multidisciplinary consortium is needed to address potential questions related to various types of viruses, variability, frequent mutations and antiviral agents and their use in humans, particularly during pandemic situations as we are now experiencing. We believe that the approach presented here has a chance to produce medically-relevant antiviral drugs against CoVs and other viral diseases. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The second challenge was to identify the main stakeholders and their strategies to address different COVID-19 countermeasures.The empirical research is based on a large pool of data. The data was collected on four routes in France where competition was expected for train services in 2020, in line with market liberalization. Notably, because the COVID-19 crisis was not anticipated, the initial purpose of the data collection was to assess the effect of train liberalization on the current train market as well as on the other modes of transport in terms of price and frequency.Consequently, the data collection started in September 2019 and was still active in December 2021 for four modes: coach, carpooling, 1 train, and air. The analysis is based on time series from September 2019 to October 2021. Prices and frequencies are discussed as the main variables on an aggregated scale for all modes then mode per mode.Finally, the intensity of the competition is analyzed on two scales: intramodal and intermodal. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is used to assess the level of competition through market concentration (Lipczynski et al., 2017) .The main results have to be considered carefully as the pandemic is ongoing as of the end of 2021. However, the progress of the vaccination programs in Europe and France during the second part of 2021 suggests a return to a normal state of the market. The first finding was the severe crisis in terms of supply during the first lockdown in March 2020. Throughout the rest of 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 countermeasures had progressively less impact, and services increased slowly, with rail and carpooling recovering to a level similar to their 2019 levels. However, thisis not yet the case for coach and air services. The second finding is that the market is concentrated to the advantage of the dominant mode, rail services, especially in comparison to air services, which are the main challenger for long-distance trips. Air services still face difficulties recovering, mainly because of reduction in the business market.The third finding highlights the persistence of conventional services during the different lockdowns and the high variability of low-cost services, which disappeared during the crisis. However, no operator went bankrupt or left the market during the crisis, mainly thanks to public support. Moreover, low-cost services recovered faster in September-October 2021 than conventional services, thereby increasing their market share. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in greater intramodal competition, mainly between the incumbent and challengers in each mode. The last finding reveals the crisis in the business market (Caputo et al., 2021) caused by alternatives to business travel (such as videoconferencing and teleworking). This crisis may explain the challenges conventional services face when confronted by low-cost services better adapted to the leisure market. Additionally, it suggests a new paradigm of work and travel based on the development of alternatives to physical mobility. It confirms the concept of a \\\"new normal\\\" and questions public national incumbents' business models, which are traditionally dependent on business users.There are several practical implications for policymakers and operators. First, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the key role public national incumbents play during a crisis in ensuring a minimal service when other operators stop running as well as providing specific services, like sanitary trains in France. Second, there is a risk that the end of public financial support will transform the long-distance transport market into \\\"business for survival\\\" as the sector is highly sensitive to COVID-19 countermeasures and has become more competitive, mainly because of reduced demand (especially from the business market). Finally, most of the market segments are duopolies, so there is a high risk of monopolies developing if challenger operators go bankrupt. Public regulators must remain vigilant in the immediate future regarding the effects of COVID-19 countermeasures and public financial support to avoid greater market concentration. This paper is structured in six sections. Section 2 presents the motivations underlying the French case and the context for long-distance services. Section 3 describes the data collection and method. Section 4 gives the general results, after which Section 5 discusses them mode by mode. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.There are several reasons for selecting France as a case study. First, the French market is characterized by a wide variety of services for long-distance travel, from rail services to carpooling, as described in Subsection 2.1. Subsection 2.2 shows that during the pandemic, France, like other European countries, imposed strict sanitary regulations and multiple lockdowns as well as other restrictions, affecting long-distance travel. Finally, Subsection 2.3 highlights the crisis's severe impact on demand for travel and transport companies.The French case is interesting due to the wide choice of transport services available on long-distance routes. Laroche and Lamatkhanova (2021) showed that the diversity of services in the French market is similar to Germany's, Italy's, and the UK's. The services are predominantly train, coach, carpooling, and air. Consequently, analyzing the French market can offer insights into trends in other markets after considering certain specificities of the French market.First, most segments of the long-distance travel market are either duopolies or monopolies. Second, some of them are quite new and were still consolidating when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Third, low-cost services are well established in the market.More specifically, train services are still a monopoly run by the national incumbent, SNCF. The initial competitors were expected in 2020, but the first lockdown and other countermeasures delayed project until the end of 2021.However, the high-speed market can be characterized as an innovative service, because SNCF was the first European operator to develop the concept of low-cost high-speed services (called Ouigo) in 2013. It is interesting to distinguish low-cost services (Ouigo) from traditional services (inOui) and analyze the internal competition between the two. Air services are a duopoly for long-distance trips (journeys that are three hours longer by rail) and a monopoly for shorter trips. The national incumbent is traditionally Air France, which competes with easyJet. The coach market is relatively new in France in so far as it has only been open to competition since 2015 (Blayac & Bougette, 2017) . One of the first players was Flixbus. There were several competitors in the early years but, confronted by the consolidation of the market, most are now limited to niche markets. There were two main competitors at the beginning of 2020 before the first lockdown: Flixbus and BlaBlaBus. BlaBlaBus can be considered a challenger, and its history is original. Launched by the national train company (SNCF) in 2014 (as iDBUS), the company was bought by BlaBlaCar, the French leader in carpooling services, in 2019 with the aim of becoming a multimodal actor in the passenger transport market. Lastly, BlaBlaCar is a carpooling services success story in France and Europe. Established in 2006, it boasted 100 million members in 2021 (Business Insider France, 2021).The next sections consider the effect of COVID-19 on transport overall and on each of the four modes individually.Another motivating factor to examine the French case is the French government's decision to counter COVID-19 with a wide range of regulations. Figure 1 illustrates the chronology of these regulations from 2020 to 2021.The first lockdown was imposed in March 2020, some days after Italy but in line with the majority of other European countries. For eight weeks-from March 17, 2020, to May 11, 2020-mobility was curtailed to one hour per day within a one kilometer radius of one's residence with a pass. From May 11, 2020, to May 28, 2020, the restrictions on local mobility were loosened but stayed restrictive for long-distance mobility, with journeys limited to 100 kilometers for essential reasons only. Long-distance transport services were particularly impacted by these F I G U R E 1 Timeline of the COVID-19 countermeasures in France. Source: Author restrictions. Summer 2020 was unique for several reasons. On the surface, it looked like a \\\"normal\\\" summer; however, the public were obliged to wear masks in public, including on transport, potentially negatively impacting longdistance services. In addition, the limitation of international trips and the rising \\\"fear of social contact\\\" changed mobility behaviors and habits that summer, especially regarding long-distance journeys. The COVID-19 countermeasures of summer 2020 (a lower level of restriction but permanent sanitary regulations, such as the use of masks) persisted until early September, when universities reopened their doors and invited students to travel long distances to be physically present in the classroom after six months of online courses. Unfortunately, the number of COVID-19 cases increased drastically that autumn, leading the French government to implement the second lockdown from October 30, 2020, to December 15, 2020. Prior to the second lockdown, there was a period of curfews from nine p.m. until six p.m. in the most infected localities.The second lockdown was similar to the first. Trips were limited to one kilometer from one's residence for one hour a day with a pass. Additionally, a curfew throughout mainland France was implemented from six p.m. Once again, long-distance services were deeply impacted. Universities closed their doors until summer 2021, and teleworking became the norm for millions of workers. Although the second lockdown was lifted in December 2020, restrictions remained very strict throughout winter 2021, with the national six p.m. curfew and the closure of restaurants, bars, and ski resorts. The third lockdown was ordered from April 3, 2021, to May 3, 2021. Since then, the restrictions have been progressively alleviated, and the curfew ended on June 30, 2021. Summer 2021 was characterized by the permanence of restrictions, like mask-wearing, and the introduction of a vaccination pass, excluding non-vaccinated people from certain modes of transport (air and train), restaurants, and other places. ByOctober 2021, 70% of the French population had been vaccinated against COVID-19, making it possible to return to \\\"normal\\\" life. The mass teleworking policy was removed, and universities reopened. This research compares autumn 2021 to September-October 2019 to assess the effects of eighteen months of restrictions and verify if a \\\"new normal\\\" has emerged from this period.To conclude, long-distance services have been particularly impacted by the different measures to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. This is because long-distance trips were prohibited for many months for the majority of the French population, plus the closure of universities and mass teleworking resulted in no demand from the student and business markets.This last subsection highlights the effect of COVID-19 on demand for long-distance transport services. It also compares the French trends to the European averages. From a general point of view, the collapse in demand for long-distance transport services in France is similar to the rest of Europe. For France's train market, demand decreased by 41% in 2020 compared to 2019 and by 48% on average in Europe (IRG-Rail, 2021). The situation was similar for air, with a decrease of 67% for Air France and \\\"only\\\" 46% for easyJet. The average in Europe was slightly higher with a decrease of 73% in 2020 compared to 2019 (Eurostat, 2021) . For both modes, teleworking and fewer business travelers deeply impacted the overall dynamic (Caputo et al., 2021) .For coach services, demand decreased by 65% over the period (Autorit\\u00e9 de R\\u00e9gulation des Transports, 2021b).Carpooling services were less affected by the collapse in demand than other modes of transport with \\\"only\\\" a 25% reduction in demand (V\\u00e9rier, 2021) . It is possible that the user profile for carpooling is less sensitive to COVID-19 because of age or another factor.Finally, it is interesting to consider that traffic on France's high-speed roads increased by 7.6% during summer 2021 compared to summer 2019 according to Vinci Autoroute (Investir, 2021) . This finding suggests that long-distance trips experienced a similar behavioral change as urban mobility, where an increase in car use has been observed (Klein et al., 2021; Macharis, 2021) .Subsection 3.1 presents the study's parameters. Details of the data collection are described in Subsection 3.2, and Subsection 3.3 explains the method.The analysis is based on four main routes in France as shown in Figure 2 : Paris-Lyon, Paris-Bordeaux, Paris-Toulouse, and Paris-Nice.The initial research question was about the effect of a new competitor on long-distance train travel; therefore, these four routes were selected because a new train operator was expected to challenge the incumbent in the context of market liberalization in 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the introduction of competition and necessitated changing the research question.The four routes were also chosen in the hope of including routes with different characteristics, like travel time.Lyon and Bordeaux are less than three hours from Paris, while Toulouse and Nice are more than three hours from the capital. Consequently, the Toulouse and Nice are served by more flights but fewer trains and other services, like carpooling and coaches. Moreover, the Paris-Lyon route is one of the most used high-speed lines in Europe, serving more than 44 million travelers in 2019.F I G U R E 2 Study parameters. Source: AuthorData were collected every Tuesday since September 2019 on each route and for four modes of transport: train, air, coach, and carpooling. Tuesday was selected for its representativeness during the week. The collection was performed one week before the departure date except for carpooling because of the high variation of supply at the last minute. In this case, collection was performed one day before to consider more than 90% of the supply.The data collection concerned each mode and each service (only direct travel without connections) during the day, and looked at price, schedule, and travel time. In total, the data cover 87 days and comprise more than 14,000 observations 2 between September 2019 and October 2021.The main sources given in Table 1 are the websites dedicated to the different modes. Most of them are comparators because of the competition between operators. The two exceptions are for train and carpooling where the markets are monopolies. For rail, we used the SNCF's commercial website where all the train offerings are presented. For carpooling, there are several operators but only one drives the market; therefore, BlaBlaCar's website was the reference for carpooling. For the other modes, comparators were used. For air, Google Flights gave a full overview of supply, while the European website Omio.fr was used for coach services.The method is based on time series and a descriptive analysis. The times series are given from September 2019 to October 2021. The variations between 2019 and 2021 are calculated on the basis of two reference months:September and October.The main variables used to give an overview of the market evolution are price, number of seats, and number of services (frequency).The price is given as an average price per kilometer for each mode or service. The number of seats is given per day for each mode and service. It is based on the number of seats per service and their frequency during the day.The number of seats can change from one service to another according to its characteristics. This is especially true for train services. For example, a low-cost service proposes 634 seats versus 510 for a conventional high-speed rail service (Autorit\\u00e9 de R\\u00e9gulation des Transports, 2021a). There is less heterogeneity for the other modes. The standard number of seats for a coach service is 50, 3 165 for a standard Airbus A320, 4 and four at most per car for a car.Finally, the frequency is based on the number of services a day.Competition is assessed via the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. It is a well-known index usually used to assess a market's concentration (Lipczynski et al., 2017) . It is based on each operator's market share. In this study, the 2 One observation corresponds to one service one way for one schedule.3 https://location.flixbus.fr/services/location-bus-places#:$:text=Location%20de%20bus%2036%20%2D%2050,bus%20qu'il%20vous%20faut. 4 https://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/airbus-a320/2-les-nombreux-heritiers-de-l-a320/#:$:text=L'A320%2C%20qui%20se%20d%C3%A9cline, hauteur%20de%2011%2C76%20m%C3%A8tres. Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is calculated on the basis of the number of seats for each mode or type of service per day. It is the best indicator to give a realistic view of the level of concentration within a market taking into account the capacity of each mode and frequency of the services.The results are split into two sections. Subsection 4.1 gives an overview of the COVID-19 effects in terms of price and capacity, while Subsection 4.2 focuses on the effects of the pandemic on each mode of transport.The the market (respectively, 0.4% and 2.2% in 2019), rail increased its market share, while air services fell from 17% in 2019 to 13% in 2021. The first lockdown was very severe for air services, when the market share dropped to 4.6% before recovering to around 11% during the two other lockdowns. Nevertheless, the situation remains difficult for air services. For the other modes, it is interesting to consider that carpooling has been more consistent than the other modes with a modal share between 0.4% and 0.2%. However, coach services have been significantly impacted with the stoppage of services during the second and third lockdowns, resulting in rail services taking a greater share of the market.According to Figure 5 , the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index increased by 9.8% over the period, with a peak during the first lockdown, placing the rail incumbent in a dominant position within the market. Figure 6 shows that rail can be observed, especially for coach services, who are well known for their flexibility, but also for rail and air. To conclude, the return of rail services to their initial capacity may hide a lower utilization rate of rail than in 2019. This situation could limit the market power of rail services, particularly in terms of prices.Regarding price, COVID-19 has had unexpected effects. Figure 7 the modes. They decreased during the first and second lockdowns but increased during the third. This can be explained by the significant reduction in supply and state financial support to maintain a minimal service during the first two lockdowns. Concerning train services, it is interesting that the average price per kilometer was similar to that for carpooling. It can provide from the development of the low-cost offer whose the extinction can have a positive effect of prices (increase) as during the three lockdowns. Nevertheless, it is notable that the train incumbent did not benefit from its dominant position within the market by increasing prices. Regarding carpooling prices, the reduction could be related to the price of oil, which dropped in 2020 (INSEE, 2020) . Prices should increase in the next month as oil prices rise. Finally, coach services increased their prices after their services were paused during the lockdowns. Subsection 4.2 highlights the sector's difficulties in finding economic equilibrium.This subsection focuses on each mode's prices and frequency.Rail services can be split into two types: the conventional high-speed rail service (inOui) and the low-cost high-speed rail service (Ouigo). From a general standpoint, Figure 9 shows that the first lockdown dramatically impacted both services. The conventional high-speed rail service almost completely stopped its services, reducing them from an average of 13 trains per day to two, while the low-cost services stopped running altogether. The effect of the subsequent two lockdowns was less severe, although both times traffic was halved, and the low-cost services were more impacted than the conventional high-speed rail trains. However, the low-cost services' market share increased significantly from 2019 to 2021. The average number of conventional high-speed rail trains per day decreased by almost 15% but the number of low-cost high-speed rail trains increased by 30%. The result was a substitution of F I G U R E 8 Detailed price per mode (in \\u20ac per km). Source: Author conventional high-speed rail services for low-cost high-speed rail services and a bigger market share for low-cost high-speed rail (from 22% in 2019 to 30% in 2021). The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index decreased by 10% during the period, pointing to greater competition between the two services and a form of internal \\\"home-made\\\" competition.Concerning prices for train services, analysis is difficult because of yield management practices. Figure 10 shows that prices seemed to be more sensitive to the summer holidays than the lockdowns. Nevertheless, it is interesting to observe that prices decreased by 17% and 16%, respectively, for conventional high-speed rail and low-cost highspeed rail between 2019 and 2021. This result was unexpected in so far as the concentration of the market increased in favor of rail services during that period. At least two explanations can be given. First, the overall reduced demand generated overcapacity and put pressure on prices. This is clear for the conventional high-speed rail where frequency and prices were reduced during the period. The severe crisis in the business market linked to teleworking and videoconferencing is an explanation. Second, the train market was opened to competition in 2020. With two years of delay, the first competitors should enter the market at the end of 2021. From this perspective, the incumbent has an interest in moderating prices for conventional high-speed rail services and improving its low-cost services in order to be competitive.Air services are split between two operators. The national company, Air France, traditionally runs conventional services in opposition to easyJet, the well-known low-cost company. As shown in Figure 11 , the first lockdown had whereas easyJet's only dropped by 14%. The market share for low-cost services increased from 30% in October 2019 to 40% in October 2021, and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index fell by 8%, pointing to a higher level of competition within the market. As with conventional rail services, Air France's difficulties in returning to its initial level may be a sign of crisis in the business market, whereas easyJet is in a better situation thanks to its strong position in the leisure market supported by its low-price policy.Regarding prices, as with rail, yield management practices limit the analysis, especially during the lockdowns.However, Figure 12 highlights a strong divergence between Air France's and easyJet's strategies. Between 2019 and 2021, Air France increased its prices by 9%, while easyJet decreased theirs by 50%. As reported in Figure 12 , easyJet has an aggressive strategy of increasing supply and decreasing prices, while Air France seems to have difficulties in keeping its offerings competitive. To conclude, the low-cost services seem to have increased their market share after two years of COVID-19. This last point will be discussed further in Section 5. Figure 12. The coach market is characterized by a duopoly between two companies: Flixbus and BlaBlaBus. Whereas for rail and air services it is possible to distinguish a conventional company from a low-cost one, this is not the case for the Figure 13 presents these characteristics. Both operators adopted a similar strategy during the three lockdowns with a shutdown of their services. Flixbus had a small advantage between the second and the third lockdown as it remained alone on the market. From a general standpoint, Flixbus seems to have performed better between 2019 and 2021 than BlaBlaBus.In 2019, BlaBlaBus had a greater market share than Flixbus (49% versus 38%, respectively), but the situation reversed in September-October 2021 when Flixbus had 62% of the market versus BlaBlaBus's 18%. However, it is important to note that the frequencies are highly variable and sensitive to demand. According to Blayac and Bougette (2020) , this is a competitive advantage inherent in their business model. It can be defined as a two-sided market (Rochet & Tirole, 2003) based on a digital platform where the offer (coach companies' services) matches demand. Both companies have no buses of their own, meaning they are able to adapt their capacity and prices to meet demand. The carpooling market is unique for several reasons. First, there is only one operator for long-distance trips,BlaBlaCar. Other platforms tried to develop alternative services without success. Since 2021, BlaBlaCar can be considered the dominant digital platform for carpooling services. Second, BlaBlaCar is a digital platform where car drivers are free to share their trip and fix their price according to a limit set by the platform (calculated on the distance and based on gasoline price and tolls). Economically speaking, BlaBlaCar's business model can be defined as a two-sided market with a strong position in the long-distance market. Consequently, Figure 15 does not show planned conventional offerings but the results of an aggregate of drivers willing to share their trips. The offerings are very varied, and the peaks are strongly dependent on the holiday periods during winter (Christmas) and summer.The COVID-19 pandemic had two interesting effects on supply. First, traffic stopped during the first lockdown and significantly decreased during the other two. Second, drivers' behavior seems to have changed between 2020 and 2021. Although summer 2020 saw a classic peak, summer 2021 showed below-usual performance levels, and the overall supply fell by 6% between 2019 and 2021. The first explanation could be the simple evolution of the demand for transportation. Considering that the carpooling offer is dependent on the willingness of drivers to make trips, the carpooling supply is certainly the best indicator for assessing the level of demand for long-distance transport. Consequently, it is possible to assume that demand decreased between 2019 and 2021, especially in the leisure market. This could also explain the reduction in supply for other modes. The second explanation can be linked to the fear of social contact. This psychological effect of COVID-19, based on the fear of being infected, has been identified F I G U R E 1 5 Carpooling frequency (average number of cars per day). Source: Author F I G U R E 1 6 Average carpooling price per kilometer (per day). Source: Author regarding other modes of transport (Aaditya & Rahul, 2021) . Finally, the last assumption is based on gasoline prices.They decreased during 2020 before increasing in summer 2021. As the value of drivers' time is very high because of the cost of organizing the services, it is possible that the service has become less attractive to drivers. Figure 16 supports this hypothesis. Prices dropped by 26% throughout the period, before increasing in October 2021. If prices are linked to the price of gasoline, they did not change significantly during the summer when oil prices were already increasing.This last section discusses two further aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-distance services. Subsection 5.1proposes a spatial approach based on an analysis of seat capacities route by route. Subsection 5.2 further questions the results regarding the increase of low-cost services.In Section 4, the results were analyzed by mode of transport. In this section, the objective is to provide an analysis per route to identify the potential spatial effect of COVID-19 countermeasures in France. We recall that the data is based on the following four routes: Paris-Lyon, Paris-Bordeaux, Paris-Toulouse, and Paris-Nice. Each route has specific characteristics. First, distance is a key parameter for distinguishing them. Lyon and Bordeaux are closer to Paris (466 kilometers and 586 kilometers, respectively) than Toulouse and Nice (677 kilometers and 933 kilometers, respectively). A second characteristic is the metropolitan population. Lyon is the biggest (1.3 million inhabitants), Bordeaux and Toulouse are similar (749,595 and 783,353 inhabitants, respectively), and Nice is the smallest (550,000 inhabitants). Finally, their accessibility is heterogenic. Lyon and Bordeaux are directly linked to Paris by a high-speed line, while Toulouse and Nice are still outside the high-speed rail network. Consequently, the travel time by train to these destinations is longer, and air services to them are more developed. Considering this, it is interesting to compare these routes and identify the potential effect of COVID-19 on seat capacities. Figure 17 highlights the effect of COVID-19 on seat capacities for the four routes. The first comment is the effect of distance on seat capacities. The Paris-Lyon route is the shortest and offers the highest number of seats.The considerable difference in 2019 with Bordeaux can be explained by the fact that Lyon is larger than Bordeaux.Otherwise, Toulouse and Nice are similar in terms of supply. Toulouse has a small advantage due to its closer proximity to Paris and bigger metropolitan area. The results are in line with the standard theory of the gravity model (Hansen, 1959) . Concerning the effect of COVID-19, the reduction in the number of seats was similar for Lyon and Bordeaux (\\u00c073% and \\u00c072%, respectively) but very different for Toulouse and Nice (\\u00c051% and \\u00c090%, respectively).In this case, it is difficult to draw a general conclusion. The second lockdown had less of an impact than the first but that is highly heterogenic according to location. The effect of the latter lockdown was unexpected with a stronger effect on short distances (respectively, \\u00c054% for Lyon and \\u00c052% for Bordeaux) and a lower effect on longer distances (respectively \\u00c034% for Toulouse and \\u00c026% for Nice). Finally, all the destinations lost seat capacity in September-October 2021 in comparison to 2019. Nevertheless, the two shortest distances lost less capacity than the two others. Lyon and Bordeaux reduced their seat capacities by 5.7% and 9.5%, respectively, while Toulouse and Nice reduced them by 17.5% and 18%, respectively. The higher reduction for the latter two can be attributed to the difficulties air services faced in returning to their initial level of service. Furthermore, the better performance of Lyon and Bordeaux can be linked to the good performance of rail services as discussed in Section 4. To conclude, the cities that are not linked to the high-speed rail network or who are far from the main city (more than three hours away) have suffered more from the effect of COVID-19 than the others in terms of supply.The aforementioned results highlighted a possible increase in low-cost services for rail and air modes between 2019 and 2021. This last section tests this finding. Figure 18 compares the evolution of conventional and low-cost supplies for air and rail in terms of frequency. In September and October 2019, there were on average 120 conventional trains and flights per day for the routes investigated and 30 low-cost trains and flights. The modal share of low-cost services was around 25%. The first lockdown had a dramatic effect on both traditional and low-cost services but impacted low-cost services more. All lowcost air and rail services stopped, whereas conventional services were merely reduced. The two other lockdowns had less impact on overall traffic. However, low-cost services were still more affected than conventional ones. During the second lockdown, frequency decreased by 42% for conventional services versus 82% for low-cost services.During the last lockdown, the decrease was 38% for conventional services versus 52% for low-cost services. This confirms the greater flexibility of low-cost services, although in the case of serious crisis, the pursual of the service offer has been guaranted of service continuity.In September-October 2021, there were on average 34 low-cost services a day versus 87 for the conventional offer. There are several lessons here. First, the number of low-cost services did not increase by much (+5.5%). They regained their pre-COVID-19 levels. Second, the full service offer decreased by 28.5% over the period. Traditional air and rail services remain are far below their initial level with only 87 services per day versus 120 in 2019.F I G U R E 1 8 Average low-cost offer for rail and air per route and day versus the full service offer. Source: Author Consequently, the low-cost market share increased, but the analysis confirms that there has not been an overall increase in low-cost services. There appear to be more low-cost services because the conventional offer is still far below its initial level.To conclude, Figure 19 shows the ratio between low-cost services and conventional services for rail and air to the previous results were driven by one or the other. For both air and rail, the ratio was higher in 2021 than in 2019, which confirms the previous results. If the ratio were higher in 2019 for air, signifying a larger market share for lowcost services than for rail, it was the opposite in 2021. However, the ratio for air almost returned to the difference with rail in 2021, illustrating easyJet's aggressive strategy. It also confirms the severe crisis conventional services, traditionally driven by business trips, face (Caputo et al., 2021 ). An analysis of demand and supply would be an interesting addition to this research to further explore the effect of COVID-19 on the evolution of travel behaviors.The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the implementation of strict regulations all over the world, an unprecedented development in peacetime. These regulations significantly impacted long-distance transportation by limiting individuals' capacity to travel both between countries and within them. At the same time, behaviors changed to adapt to the lack of physical mobility, such as the rise of teleworking and videoconferencing. This study examined the effects of these regulations on long-distance transport services. France was selected as the case study because of the difficulty in obtaining international data and the country's large variety of services (rail, air, coach, and carpooling) as well as its representativeness in terms of COVID-19 countermeasures (including three lockdowns).There are several main findings, but these must be considered with caution because the pandemic, at the time of writing in November 2021, is ongoing. The first finding is the severe crisis in terms of supply during the first lockdown in March 2020. The subsequent COVID-19 countermeasures and lockdowns during the rest of 2020 and 2021 had progressively less impact on long-distance transport, and services increased slowly until rail and carpooling services were close to their 2019 levels (though coach and air services have not yet recovered to this point).The second finding is that the market is concentrated to the advantage of the dominant mode, rail services. Air services are the main challenger for long-distance trips but face difficulties in recovering their activity mainly because of the reduction in business travel.The last finding highlights the persistence of conventional services during the different lockdowns and the high variability of low-cost services, which disappeared during the crisis. However, it is interesting to consider two facts.F I G U R E 1 9 The ratio of low-cost services to classic services for train and air. Source: Author First, no operator went bankrupt during the crisis or withdrew from a route, mainly thanks to state financial support.Second, low-cost services were recovering faster in September-October 2021 than conventional services, finally increasing their market share in the air, rail, and coach markets. The crisis in the business market can explain the difficulty for conventional services confronted by low-cost ones better adapted to the leisure market. In addition, the effect is higher intramodal competition predominantly between the incumbent and challengers in each mode. Finally, the spatial approach highlights the greater resilience of long-distance travel services serving cities connected to the high-speed rail network that are close to the main cities. The cities that are not linked to the high-speed rail network or that are far from the main city (more than three hours away) have suffered more from the effects of COVID-19 than the others in terms of supply.The results show that the concept of a \\\"new normal\\\" could be applied to the French long-distance travel market considering the structural reduction of the business market. It suggests a new paradigm of work and mobility based on the development of alternatives to physical mobility (such as videoconferencing and teleworking). Moreover, the shrinking business market presents a huge challenge for the public national incumbents (SNCF, Air France) because their business models depend on business users.There are several practical implications for policymakers and operators. First of all, the COVID-19 crisis highlights the key role public national incumbents play during a crisis to ensure a minimum level of service when other operators stop their activities. They also played a key role in providing specific services, like sanitary trains in France.Second, there is a risk that the end of the state financial support will transform long-distance travel business into \\\"business for survival\\\" as the sector is highly sensitive to the effects of COVID-19 countermeasures and is still weakened by the reduction of the business market. Furthermore, most of the market segments are duopolies. There is a risk of monopolies developing should an operator go bankrupt. The public regulators must remain vigilant in the next few months regarding the effect of COVID-19 countermeasures and state financial support to avoid higher concentration within the markets. Finally, the current market evolution with fewer air services could be an interesting trend for the future, considering the objective of carbon neutrality in France and Europe by 2050. The reduction of the business market can be a relevant lever for at least two reasons. First, it may be easier to find alternatives to physical travel (such as videoconferencing) for business trips than for leisure or family trips. Second, business demand prioritizes frequency over price. A reduction of the business segment could favor fewer trains and flights per day but conversely a better utilization rate and commercial capacity thanks to the low-cost model, leading to environmental benefits.https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9961-1159\",\n          \"The lipidome is defined as the complete set of lipids present within a cell, a tissue, or an organism [1, 2] . In the last decades, it has become clear that the lipidome, as well as the transcriptome and the proteome, is in a dynamic balance and it can be affected by physio-pathological conditions, stimuli, and changes in diet [3, 4] . Lipidomics is a relatively new \\\"-omics\\\" that characterizes, identifies, and quantifies the lipidome and its metabolic pathways and other networks that are involved within different biological mechanisms [5] . With analytical approaches, such as thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and gas chromatography (GC), lipidomics was able to develop new diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies [6] ; but it was with the advent of the next-generation mass spectrometry (MS) that there have been significant advances in the field of lipidomics [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In a typical lipidomic workflow, lipids are extracted from the biological matrices using organic solvents and analyzed by direct infusion into a mass spectrometer (technique known as \\\"shotgun\\\" lipidomics), or separated by liquid (LC) or gas chromatography (GC), prior to detection by MS. These two approaches are complementary, since the \\\"shotgun\\\" method allows a larger lipid profiling by simultaneous identification of several classes of lipids, meanwhile LC or GC/MS enable a more targeted analysis with the detection of structurally similar lipids belonging to a single class [12] [13] [14] . In both methods, the quantification is performed using a ratio against internal standard(s), which is routinely added for sample normalization and matrix effect influence correction. Internal standard structures and physicochemical properties are representative of the endogenous lipid species of interest and are added at the earliest possible step during sample preparation. For shotgun lipidomics, a semiquantification is generally possible by using exogenous lipids representative of the main lipid classes of interest; whereas for targeted lipidomics, labeled lipids (i.e., deuterated internal standards) should be included for absolute quantification. In the last few years, the aforementioned advanced analytical techniques have led to multiple improvements in lipidomics, particularly in the extraction methods and bioinformatics. These enhancements have allowed important goals, such as the identification of several lipid-based biomarkers, useful as diagnostic tools [5, 10] . However, the number of lipidomics studies in the field of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remains rather limited, especially when compared to the numerous investigations about their transcriptome and proteome. Thus, the objective of the current review was to focus on recently highlighted roles of specific bioactive lipid species and their involvement in the MSCs-related inflammatory scenario.MSCs are non-hematopoietic multipotent progenitor cells with the ability to differentiate into different mesodermal lineages including osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes [15, 16] . The three criteria adopted by the International Society for Cellular Therapy to define and identify MSCs are: (1) MSCs must be adherent to plastic under standard culture conditions;(2) their phenotypes must present the expression of CD105, CD73, and CD90 and lack the expression of the hematopoietic cell surface markers CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79\\u03b1, or CD19 and HLA-DR; (3) they must be able to differentiate under stimulation in vitro into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondroblasts [17, 18] . MSCs are currently being studied in many preclinical and clinical applications. In particular, they have attracted the scientific interest for their ability to regulate inflammatory processes and promote tissue repair due to their multi-lineage differentiation potential, pro-angiogenic characteristics, and immune-modulatory properties [19] [20] [21] . Recently, MSC-based treatment has been proposed as a suitable therapeutic approach for the severe acute respiratory infection caused by the corona virus SARS-CoV-2. In the COVID-19 scenario, where the immune system produces large amounts of inflammatory factors, the MSC therapy can prevent the storm release of cytokines by the immune system and promote endogenous repair through their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and reparative properties [22, 23] .Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of MSCs, largely mediated by paracrine signaling [24] , is currently under investigation for several degenerative, autoimmune, and inflammatory disorders, as well as the exact mechanisms underlying their effect [21] . Nevertheless, it is very likely that either a direct cell-cell contact and/or the secretion of soluble factors, including bioactive lipids, and/or extracellular vesicles (EVs) are needed [24] [25] [26] .Generally, MSCs can modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses in vitro and in vivo due to their ability to inhibit T-cell proliferation and dendritic cell maturation, recruit regulatory T-cells, and modulate B-cell functions [21, 27, 28] . Expanded for the first time from human bone marrow (BM), MSCs can also be collected and cultured from several sources including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, or umbilical cord blood and expanded ex vivo for clinical use [29, 30] . Compared to BMs, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have an easier and faster growth in culture, age with a lower rate, maintain the mesenchymal pluripotency and stem cell phenotype even after a high number of passages in culture, and show a great proliferative rate with a consequent relatively high yield (about 2500 fold higher than BM) [15, 16, 31, 32] . Moreover, ASCs have shown a great potential of differentiation into several cellular lineages and a good stability throughout long-term cultures; they are characterized by immunomodulatory properties making them immunosuppressive [30] . Moreover, their secretome presents a mix of cytokines, extracellular matrix molecules and proteases, lipid mediators, hormones, and growth factors that are also involved in the angiogenesis process with a great utility and applicability in wound healing and tissue regeneration [15, [33] [34] [35] . In addition to BMSCs and ASCs, skeletal muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) have been used in clinical trials for the regener-ation and repair of injured tissues, because of their high proliferation rate and their ability to secrete trophic factors promoting endogenous tissues repair [36] ; moreover, MDSCs harvesting consists in micro-biopsies obtained as small skin punctures under local anesthesia [37, 38] . Although they exhibit slow-growing adherent behavior after isolation, MDSCs are characterized by a long-term self-renewal, and an easy differentiation into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes in vitro [37] .Endogenous bioactive lipids cover a pivotal role in very important biological phenomena, such as inflammation, immune regulation, and maintenance of homeostasis [39, 40] . Indeed, defects in their metabolism and unbalanced biosynthesis are involved in the pathogenesis and clinical course of chronic inflammation diseases [39, 40] . Based on their biosynthesis, bioactive lipids can be grouped into different families (Table 1) : polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)-derived mediators (generally known as eicosanoids), endocannabinoids (eCBs), and lysophospholipids (LPLs) [41] . Bioactive lipids derived from PUFA can be further divided into two subgroups: one is represented by \\u03c96 arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 \\u03c96)-derived lipid mediators, including prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes (LTs), thromboxanes (TXs), and lipoxins (LXs); the other includes \\u03c93-PUFA-derived lipid mediators, such as the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 \\u03c93) and the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 \\u03c93), i.e., E-series and D-series resolvins (Rvs), protectins (PDs), and maresins (MaRs), collectively termed \\\"specialized pro-resolving mediators\\\" (SPMs). Except for LXs, \\u03c96-PUFA-derived lipids are pro-inflammatory, in contrast with \\u03c93-PUFA-derived lipids, which act as anti-inflammatory. In detail, SPMs stimulate key cellular events, by acting as agonists, stopping further neutrophil influx and the activation of non-phlogistic responses by macrophages and, therefore, leading to the resolution of the inflammation. ECBs and eCB-like compounds originate from \\u03c96and \\u03c93-PUFA metabolism, but also from saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (SFA and MUFA), such as palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0), or oleic acids (18:1 n9). Nowadays, pro-and anti-inflammatory properties exerted by eCBs and eCB-like compounds are issues of intense research [42, 43] . Finally, membrane-derived bioactive lipids derived from LPLs can be divided into lysoglycerophospholipids (LGPLs) and lysosphingophospholipids (LSLs), based on the presence of glycerol or sphingosine (S) as backbone of their structures. LPLs exert pleiotropic effects such as inflammation, vesicular trafficking, endocytosis, apoptosis, cell migration, and cell-stress responses [44] . In this review, we will outline the biological activities and metabolisms of the major bioactive lipids identified as essential regulators in the complex scenario of inflammation and as players in the immunoregulation exerted by MSCs. LGPLs, LSLsThe group of eicosanoids represents the widest family of bioactive lipids and includes several molecules characterized by the long carbon chain \\u03c96 AA or \\u03c93 EPA and DHA as common precursors. \\u03c96 AA, released from membrane phospholipids firstly via phospholipase A2 and secondarily by phospholipase C, is the substrate for three different enzymes leading to the generation of pleiotropic and heterogenous compounds: (1) cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 (COX-1/2) drive the synthesis of PGs (PGD 2 , PGE 2 , PGI 2 , and PGF 2\\u03b1 ), prostacyclins, and TXs [45, 46] , also known as prostanoids; (2) 5-, 12-and 15-lypooxygenases (5/12/15-LOX) synthetize LTs [47, 48] , lipoxins (LXs) [49] and hydroxyeicosatetraenoids (HETEs) [50] ; (3) P450 epoxygenase generates also HETEs, and epoxyeicosatrienoids (ETEs) [50] . \\u03c93 PUFAs-derived bioactive products are Rvs, PDs, and MaRs. Rvs derive from either EPA or DHA and can be further divided into E-series or D-series, respectively. DHA acts also as a precursor for the biosynthesis of PDs and MaRs ( Figure 1 ). The \\u03c96 eicosanoids play an essential active role in the inflammatory response, such as leukocyte chemotaxis and activation, fever, pain [40] , and are usually associated to acute inflammatory processes and chronic inflammation. Indeed, PGs seem to promote inflammation through several mechanisms such as increasing the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines [51] [52] [53] , enhancing the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, promoting innate immunity response [54] , recruiting leukocytes and activating two distinct T helper subsets, TH1 and TH17 [55, 56] . LTs generally recruit neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, and TH17 lymphocytes, and are responsible for the induction of edema. Vasoconstriction and vasodilatation are promoted instead by TXs and prostacyclins, respectively [57] . On the other hand, the \\u03c93 family seems to have a beneficial impact on inflammation, by acting via different mechanisms, for example by working as substrate competitors able to inhibit the conversion of AA into pro-inflammatory eicosanoids or serving as an alternative substrate to produce less potent LTs, PGs, and TGs. In animal models, Rvs and PDs shorten the resolution of inflammation for certain diseases [41, 58, 59] and can also increase animal survival [60, 61] . Two of the major Rvs, RvD1 and RvD2, have shown in vivo anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution properties, by blocking the neutrophil infiltration in many disorders, such as obesity and pathologies affecting the vascular [62] , renal and dermal systems, and also in processes as wound healing, fibrosis, and pain [60] . Moreover, \\u03c93 PUFAderived mediators that have been found within the inflammatory exudate (RvE1 and PD1) show great anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions both in vitro and in vivo [51, 63] . However, the resolution of inflammation is also mediated by other metabolites of AA [64] . Indeed, PGJ (15-deoxy-delta-13,14-PGJ 2 ), the bioconversion product of PGD 2 , increases during the resolution phase and acts as a brake on inflammation by inducing apoptosis of inflammatory cells [65] . The concentration of the lipoxygenase product LXA 4 (lipoxin A 4 ) is also increased during the resolution phase and acts as a stop signal for the acute response [66] . Finally, AA-derived EETs present anti-inflammatory properties through the suppression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) activation and govern vasorelaxation and fibrinolysis [67] .eCBs are endogenous lipid compounds that can bind G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) in the same way as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of Cannabis sativa. The plant Cannabis sativa and its preparations, marijuana and hashish, are being used for many years for recreational and medical purposes [68] because of the pleasurable effects triggered by THC, modulated by the other major, nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid, called cannabidiol (CBD). Both components possess other important medical properties, such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-emetic (THC), and anxiolytic (CBD). [69] . Thanks to the studies performed on cannabis plants and their peculiar chemical components, researchers were able to discover one of the most intriguing and pleiotropic endogenous signaling systems, the endocannabinoid system (eCBS). eCBs, CB receptors, and the biochemical entities that produce and degrade these lipids, are involved in most aspects of the mammalian physiology and pathology [70] . The compound arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA) [71] , the first isolated ethanolamide of AA, represents a partial agonist of CB receptors, while 2-arachidonoylglicerol (2-AG) (another derivative of AA) [72, 73] , is a full agonist ( Figure 1 ). Both compounds AEA and 2-AG belong to the group of PUFA AA-related lipid mediators, and as CB receptor ligands, they stimulate a variety of bioactivities, including analgesia, catalepsy, hypolocomotion, and hypothermia [68] . Moreover, AEA exhibits anti-inflammatory properties [74] , whereas 2-AG shows both proand anti-inflammatory characteristics [75, 76] . Thus, dysfunctions leading to changes in concentration levels, metabolism, and receptors of eCBs could be related to alterations in homeostasis and to the progression of chronic inflammatory status [77] . Moreover, two metabolically active \\u03c93 fatty acid ethanolamides, N-eicosapentaenoylethanolamine (EPEA) and N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine (DHEA) [78, 79] , have been proposed as additional CB receptor agonists [80] . These \\u03c93 eCBs were found to possess anti-inflammatory properties in macrophages [81] and adipocytes [82] . In addition to CB1 and CB2 receptors, pharmacological studies suggest the presence also of different receptors that can mediate the cannabinoids effects. Indeed, besides AEA, other ethanolamides coming from various longchain fatty acids were discovered, and collectively known as N-acylethanolamines (NAEs). Ethanolamides of SFA and MUFA such as palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids, which are more abundant than AEA in mammals, show no activity for CB receptors, but act on other receptors, like the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\\u03b1 (PPAR\\u03b1), leading to the trigger of biological events including anti-inflammation and appetite suppression [83, 84] . In detail, the PPAR\\u03b1-mediated actions of N-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) include anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-epileptic, and neuroprotective properties [85, 86] . Moreover, PEA could also activate the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPCR55 [87] , one of the discussed candidates as CB3 receptor, even though this agonist activity has not been fully elucidated yet. Another saturated NAE, N-stearoylethanolamide (SEA), was reported to act as an anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory agent and cell growth controller, through still unknown targets [88] [89] [90] . Finally, a variety of eCB-related compounds, containing fatty acid chains conjugated with different polar heads, have been discovered as a result of advancements of the analytical techniques [91, 92] . Within the novel group of lipids generally referred as lipoamino acids, N-arachidonoylglycine (NAGly), the most important member, possesses anti-inflammatory effects by targeting the G-protein coupled receptor GPCR18 [93, 94] , vasorelaxant properties [95] and seems to be involved in cell migration [96] , and inhibition of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) [97] , the AEA inactivating enzyme. Moreover, NAgly might have either a physiological role in the resolution of acute inflammatory response and become a potential therapeutic candidate for the resolution of chronic inflammation, by increasing the production of PGJ and LXA 4 , reducing the migration of inflammatory cells into areas of acute inflammation and inducing the death of inflammatory cells [93] . eCBs are endogenous lipid compounds that can bind G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) in the same way as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of Cannabis sativa. The plant Cannabis sativa and its preparations, LPLs are bioactive signaling lipids consisting of O-acyl chain, generated from phospholipase-mediated hydrolyzation of membrane glycerophospholipids (GPLs) and sphingolipids (SLs). Consequently, LPLs are classified into two main categories: glyceryl-based LPLs (including LPA) and sphingosyl-based (including S1P) with a glycerol or a sphingosine backbone, respectively [98, 99] (Figure 1 ). Several LPLs compounds are asymmetrically distributed in the plasma membrane and are characterized by a polar head group (ethanolamine, choline, inositol, serine) and a hydrophobic tail of carbon chain. LPLs act as signaling mediators by binding seven-transmembrane domain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The two major bioactive LPLs are the well-characterized lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and they play important roles in various physio-pathological processes, including inflammation. LPA, a byproduct of lysophosphaditylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidilinositol (LPI), is a signaling mediator involved in cell renewal, immune response, and inflammatory cascade [100, 101] . LPA can be synthetized both intracellularly and extracellularly by different enzymes and via different pathways, such as autotaxin/ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 2 (ENNP2) and/or phospholipases A1 and A2, whereas its degradation is mediated by lipid phosphate phosphatases 1-3 [102] . Currently, six LPA receptors (LPA 1-6) are known [102] . Recently, LPA is reported to be rapidly formed during the resolution phase of the inflammation and, successively, to be recruited via the common pro-resolving formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2, also known as ALX), which is expressed on T cells and their subsets [103] . On the other hand, SLs, such as ceramides and sphingosines, participate in different stages of inflammation as well, by controlling intracellular trafficking and signaling, cell proliferation, adhesion, vascularization, survival, and apoptosis [104, 105] . In particular, the phosphate forms of sphingolipids, ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) and S1P [106] , are notably associated to inflammatory responses. S1P is synthesized by the intracellular phosphorylation of sphingosine via sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (SK1 and SK2) and degraded by S1P lyase or ceramide synthases. It is involved in the resolution phase (together with C1P) since apoptotic cells present at the inflammation sites attract pro-resolving macrophages via S1P receptor 1 [107] and, additionally, it can act either on COX-2 or NF-kB, whereas C1P acts on phospholipase A2 [102] .Lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in stem cells physiopathology [108] [109] [110] . However, at the moment the number of studies about the lipidome of MSCs is limited, and mainly focused on variations in lipid composition during stem cell proliferation and differentiation [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] (Figure 2) .Recently, profiles of glycerophopholipids (GPLs) present in human BMSCs were assessed from young and old donors and across passages during in vitro culture [111] [112] [113] . In particular, since the clinical use of MSCs demands sequential ex vivo expansion, the determination of GPL profiles through the different steps of the in vitro culture represents a crucial and relevant advancement. In general, long-term culturing could contribute to the decrease of the proliferation and the differentiation potential, shorten the telomers, and accumulate \\u03c96 PUFAs with signaling roles, consequently promoting inflammation [114, 115] . It is well established that membrane GPLs provide precursors for signaling lipids that modulate cellular functions, and small changes in their compositions can lead to significant biological consequences. Kilpinen et al. studied the effect of the donor's age and cell doublings on the profile of GPLs of human BMSCs, demonstrating that an extensive expansion modulates membrane GPLs, by increasing total phosphatidylinositol (PI) and lysophospatidylcholine (LPC). Specifically, the effect was more pronounced when BMSCs were isolated from young donors. Moreover, changes in membrane FAs profile during expansion and senescence of BMSCs was highlighted: the \\u03c96 AA content increased, while \\u03c93 PUFAs (especially DHA) decreased during long-term cultivation, leading to an impair-ment of the immunological functionality [111] . In addition, in the later steps of the process, an increment of the fraction of individual SFA was noticed [111] . A significant modification of membrane FAs composition of MSCs derived from human fetal membranes (FM-MSCs), occurring during in vitro culture, was assessed by Chatgilialoglu et al. [112] . In detail, fresh uncultured FM-MSCs showed variability in their membrane FAs composition, likely due to the genetic diversity and different lifestyle of the donors. This study also reveals that cultured cells have lower proportions of PUFAs than freshly isolated cells showing a great drop in \\u03c96 FAs, counterbalanced by a marked increase in MUFA and \\u03c93 FAs. These data are in contrast with Kilpinen et al. [111] . More recently, a lipidomics profiling analysis during BMSCs culturing passages by Lu et al. investigates the metabolic alteration of various lipid species in the senescence process [113] . They applied an untargeted lipidomics approach based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), which allowed the reduction of the complexity of the matrix and the enhancement of the sensitivity, factors that represent an improvement relative to the previously described shotgun-based methods. The majority of GPLs, as well as SLs, were found to significantly increase across the culturing passages, whereas the PA, PIs, and phosphatidylserines (PSs) levels were lower in aged cells. These findings were largely coherent with previous described studies, except for PI species, which were found to be increased during all the passages [111] . Nevertheless, the reduced amount of PIs is inconsistent with the relative transcriptomics analysis, which showed an increase in the enzymes expression with consequential conversion of PA into PIs suggesting an enhanced PIs biosynthesis activity. Moreover, research on the functional FAs has largely supported regulatory roles for PGs in MSCs proliferation. In particular, PGE 2 increases human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (UCMSCs) proliferation through \\u03b2-catenin-mediated c-Myc and vascular endothelial growth factor expression via exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac1)/Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1)/Akt and PKA cooperation [116] , and through interaction of profilin-1 (Pfn-1) and filamentousactin (F-actin) via EP2 receptor-dependent \\u03b2-arrestin-1/JNK signaling pathways [117] . On the contrary, the investigation of PGE 2 and prostaglandin D2 (PGD 2 ) effects on MSCs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation suggests that both their receptors are highly expressed in these cells and both prostaglandins seem to have a negative impact [118] . In detail, PGE 2 firstly enhances the MSCs growth-rate, while longer stimulation leads to a growth-inhibitory effect. Contrarily, PGD 2 inhibits MSCs growth regardless of the duration of the exposure. Moreover, their inhibitory effect on calcium deposition also suggests a negative impact on MSCs osteogenic differentiation [118] . Moreover, TXs class has been investigated for its effect on MSCs proliferation, suggesting the role of TXA 2 as potent modulator of ASCs migration and proliferation through ERK and p38 MAPK signaling mechanisms [119] . In addition, TXA 2 appears to induce ASCs differentiation into smooth-muscle-like cells [119, 120] . Concerning eCBS, Rossi et al. [121] described a gradual decrease during subculture in AEA and 2-AG levels secreted by human BMSCs starting from passage 1 (AEA: 5 pmol/mg protein and 2-AG: 11 pmol/mg protein 2-AG) and this finding was also confirmed by Kose et al. [122] . ASCs secrete AEA and 2-AG at 3.5 and 7.3 pmol/mg protein, respectively, at early passages [123] . In addition, 2-AG and CB1/CB2 stimulation recruits BMSCs, most probably via an indirect activation of CB2 receptors [124] .During MSCs differentiation, eCBS variation was also highlighted and the expression of CB1 and CB2 is considerably lower in undifferentiated cells and it increases during osteogenic [125, 126] and adipogenic commitment [125] . Furthermore, the activation of CB2 signaling plays an important role in promoting the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro, with an increase of alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), an induction of the expression of specific osteogenic genes including Runx2, Osterix, IBSP, SPP1, OCN, COL1a1, and an enhanced deposition of calcium in the extracellular matrix [126] . This result indicates a key role of CB2 receptor in BMSCs differentiation towards osteoblasts, suggesting also that MSCs might produce endogenous cannabinoids able to reinforce their osteogenic differentiation as well. Moreover, the knockdown of CB2 receptor in BMSCs by small interference RNA (siRNA) inhibits ALP activity and mineralization [126] . Most recently the osteogenic differentiation induced by CB2 signaling activation has been shown to involve autophagy induction and sequestosome 1/p62-mediated Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2Related Factor 2 deactivation [127] . Whereas, the implication of eCBs in BMSCs physiology related to their adipocyte differentiation was validated looking at the increased expression of CB1, transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) and PPAR\\u03b3 during adipogenesis [128] . Moreover, the effects of AEA, N-arachidonoydopamine (NADA), and 2-AG were evaluated suggesting a promotion of adipocyte differentiation by AEA and an inhibition by NADA. No changes were observed with 2-AG at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Furthermore, CB1 may stimulate protein expression, such as adiponectin during adipogenesis [125, 129] , since it is enriched in mature adipocytes compared to other cell types [129] . Moreover, based on the effect of AEA, CB1 expression seems to be correlated to the increment of FAAH and COX-2 during adipogenic differentiation [130] . Lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in stem cells physiopathology [108] [109] [110] . However, at the moment the number of studies about the lipidome of MSCs is limited, and mainly focused on variations in lipid composition during stem cell proliferation and differentiation [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] (Figure 2 ). Recently, profiles of glycerophopholipids (GPLs) present in human BMSCs were assessed from young and old donors and across passages during in vitro culture [111] [112] [113] . In particular, since the clinical use of MSCs demands sequential ex vivo expansion, the determination of GPL profiles through the different steps of the in vitro culture represents a crucial and relevant advancement. In general, long-term culturing could contribute to the decrease of the proliferation and the differentiation potential, shorten the telomers, and accumulate \\u03c96 PUFAs with signaling roles, consequently promoting inflammation [114, 115] . It is well established that membrane GPLs provide precursors for signaling lipids that modulate cellular functions, and small changes in their compositions can lead to significant biological consequences. Kilpinen et al. studied the effect of the donor's age and cell doublings on the profile of GPLs of human BMSCs, demonstrating that an exten- In addition, Pagano et al. found out that ASCs exposed to the synthetic cannabinoid WIN55,212-2 increase the glucose uptake, the calcium influx, and the expression of the adipogenesis regulator PPAR-\\u03b3; contrarily, these effects are inhibited by the specific CB1antagonist Rimonabant [131] . Finally, Silva et al. has analyzed the lipidome of rabbit ASCs and MDSCs and their adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation identifying 1687 lipid species [132] . These animal MSCs have shown different lipid profiles as well as changes in lipid composition after adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, the N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) expression levels suggest lipid similarities in cells differentiated from different stem cell sources [132] . In conclusion, PUFAs and their bioactive derivatives affect both the proliferation and differentiation of several MSCs and consequently modulate their immunological interaction with other cells. In this perspective, lipid profiling can represent a valuable tool also in the screening of MSC populations prior to their use in both experimental and clinical settings. Indeed, the possibility of evaluating selected lipid classes or MSC entire lipidome can rapidly provide a screenshot of their differentiative status and growth rate, thus, allowing to harness MSC potential at its best for the diverse applications.MSCs present anti-inflammatory properties and are being used with great success as treatment for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. They have been shown to migrate towards injured tissues affected by inflammatory events, led by several growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines [133] . Being physiologically recruited at the damaged site, MSCs are often submitted to a strong, pro-inflammatory environment. It is well known that the PGE 2 secretion is increased upon incubation with the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\\u03b1) and the interferon gamma (IFN-\\u03b3) [28] . To better understand the involvement of the lipidome in the MSCs anti-inflammatory properties and underlying its mechanisms of action, Campos et al. [134] have performed a wide range lipidomic analysis of MSCs under pro-inflammatory conditions induced by the presence of 10 ng/mL TNF-\\u03b1 and 500 U/mL IFN-\\u03b3. This study has evidenced a change in MSCs PL profile under the pro-inflammatory stimulus: indeed, higher levels of molecular PC species with longer FA acyl chains and lower levels of molecular PC species with shorter FA acyl chains were assessed. Moreover, the expressions of the specific PE(40:6), PS(36:1), LPC(18:0), and SM(34:0) were enhanced, while PE(O-38:6) and PS(40:4) expressions decreased simultaneously. The increase of LPC (18:0) has already been correlated with anti-inflammatory properties by others [135, 136] . These differences were identified only in specific GPL subspecies, suggesting that each GPL subspecies could play a role in MSCs immunological functions. Moreover, the characteristics of the lipidome of the untreated MSCs described by Campos et al. were consistent with previous results [111] , with the exception of the presence of sphingomyelins [134] , which have not been previously identified. As formerly described, some derivatives of SLs, such as S1P, are bioactive and mediate essential cell functions [137] .Concerning the MSCs lipid secretion, PGE 2 was widely investigated given its key role in the immunosuppressive activity of MSCs [28] . Masoodi and colleagues [138] have analyzed the release of PGs by human heart-derived MSCs by HPLC-MS/MS, finding the presence of PGE 1 , PGE 2 , PGE 3 , 6-keto PGF 1\\u03b1 , PGF 2\\u03b1 , and PGJ 2 in the conditioned medium. Although PGE 2 has been linked to the immunosuppressive effects of MSCs since their inhibitors production attenuate MSC-mediated immunomodulation [28] , PGs are best known for their ability to mediate vasodilatation that allows immune cells to invade inflamed tissue. Indeed, recent evidence suggests also that PGE 2 may have an immunostimulatory role by facilitating Th1 differentiation and expanding the Th17 Tcells population [55] . Since prostaglandins have a short half-life, they act as paracrine and autocrine factors in the local environment. MSCs themselves also express receptors for prostaglandins: EP1, EP2, EP4, FP, and IP. The effects triggered by the stimulation of these receptors on MSCs are still unknown. However, the profile of PGs highlighted in MSCs is superimposable with that of their receptors (prostaglandins type E and F, and prostacyclin). Thus, the dual and controversial immunomodulatory properties of MSCs can depend on the local environment, where IFN-\\u03b3 and TNF-\\u03b1 play a pivotal role in promoting immunosuppressive function of MSCs [139, 140] .In the presence of PGE 2 , also a higher expression of EP3, which is involved in the stimulation of angiogenesis, was obtained in MSCs suggesting a possible correlation with the early phases of inflammation [118] .Recent studies have evidenced the roles of LXs as regulators of the resolution phase of inflammation [61] and of Rvs as players in the immunoregulation of MSCs [141] . Fang et al. have demonstrated the MSCs ability of promoting the resolution of acute lung injuries in mice through the secretion of lipoxin A 4 (LXA 4 ), the first identified anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediator [142] , signaling via the G protein coupled ALX/FPR2 receptors [141] .The \\u03c93 fatty acids EPA and DHA, which are found mainly in marine oils, have long been thought to have anti-inflammatory properties, whereby they compete with AA, by reducing pro-inflammatory eicosanoids [143] . The molecular mechanism through which this occurs is still unclear, and there are no evidences about beneficial effects of \\u03c93 EPA and DHA for human health as well as their role as potential treatments for human diseases. In most mammalian cell types, different exogenous supplements of PUFAs are incorporated into plasma membrane GPL and then metabolized by phospholipases in order to produce various lipid mediators. Thus, the biochemical homeostasis of lipid profile in mammalian membranes must be perturbed not only by physio-pathological inputs, but also by external lipid uptake (i.e., dietary fats). A recent study performed on human BMSCs has demonstrated the increase of the secretion of the pro-inflammatory PGE 2 after AA supplements intake. However, this possible harmful effect can be attenuated by the chain elongation on the less active precursor, \\u03c96 22:4. The \\u03c93 PUFAs precursor, the alfa-linolenic acid (18:3), shows a slight reduction of its GPL AA content, while the EPA (20:5) and DHA (22:6) acid supplements efficiently displace the AA, creating several pools of GPL species substrates that allow attenuation of inflammatory signaling [144] .Osteoarthritis (OA) is a heterogeneous chronic joint disease characterized by the processes of degradation, repair, and inflammation that occur in the connective tissue, the vulnerable layer of joints, synovium, and subchondral bone [145] . From a molecular point of view, the catabolic and anabolic activities are unbalanced, and the major injury response occurs at the joint cartilage level. Recently, findings regarding the involvement of lipids in OA development and progression indicate a possible involvement of \\u03c93 PUFAs and their anti-inflammatory SPMs derivatives [146] . The most studied bioactive lipids, PGs and LTs, have been detected in plasma and synovial fluid of OA patients showing pro-inflammatory and catabolic effects on fibroblasts, osteoblasts and cartilage [147] . Moreover, the PGE 2 and AA-derived oxylipin 15-HETE levels were related to knee OA [148] , suggesting a possible role in the disease progression. Because of the similarities between OA course and chronic wound accompanied by cell death, inflammation, and pain [149] and since \\u03c93 PUFAs/SPMs have been shown to target all these processes, it is conceivable that these lipids could be effective therapeutic agents for OA. In the context of this disease, few studies have investigated the FAs presence in OA affecting patients and their relationship to clinical symptoms. These studies indicated that increases of \\u03c93 FAs levels could be associated with a reduced cartilage loss while the increase of the increase of \\u03c96 FAs levels with enhanced synovitis [150] . All studies performed with \\u03c93 PUFAs suggest that the beneficial effects consist primarily in an improvement in symptoms and pain, whereas little effects are observed on structural progression of the OA disease. However, previous studies have reported that \\u03c93 PUFAs can counteract the pro-inflammatory and catabolic actions of interleukin-1a (IL-1a) on cartilage in vitro [151] . These results were consistent with a more recent study in which the authors have shown the involvement of DHA in the downregulation of MMP-13 through a P38 mitogen activated protein kinases (p38-MAPK)-mediated mechanism [152] both in vitro and in vivo in a rat model of OA. Apart from direct effects of \\u03c93 PUFAs on OA, it is conceivable that \\u03c93-derived oxylipins could be generated in vitro (i.e., by chondrocytes) and these could mediate the observed effects. Another study confirmed the presence of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, such as PGE 2 , in OA synovial fluid, as well as oxylipins derived from \\u03c93 and \\u03c96 PUFA such as 15-HETE (derived from AA), 17-HDHA (derived from DHA), and 18-HEPE (derived from EPA). When the pro-inflammatory response occurs in the cartilage, some types of prostanoid enzymes, such as COX, will be produced and released in excessive amounts. COX activation will increase the production of MMP, inhibit the expression of PGE 2 and collagen genes and will stimulate the apoptosis process. Studies conducted by Hardy et al. [153] and Shimpo et al. [154] have analyzed the role of PGE 2 in chondro-cytes. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1\\u03b2 stimulates the production of PGE 2 in large quantities, and this could induce the degradation process of OA. At the molecular level, IL-1\\u03b2 will increase the expression of the COX-2 gene and the microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 at mRNA and protein levels. Therefore, an increase in PGE 2 production is related to mPGES-1 and COX-2 derivatives from osteoarthritis chondrocytes stimulated by IL-1\\u03b2. Another recent study has shown the beneficial effects of resolvin D1 on OA chondrocytes. RvD1 belongs to the family of D-series Rvs, which includes RvD2-RvD6 and share the common precursor 17-HDHA. In one study, RvD1 was found to inhibit the IL-1\\u03b2-mediated upregulation of COX-2, PGE 2 , MMP13, and nitric oxide and to prevent chemically induced apoptosis in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes [155] . These effects are mediated by the downregulation of the nuclear factor NF-kB, p38-MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases activation, as well as inactivation of caspase9 and upregulation of Bcl-2 and Akt. Despite the high concentrations of RvD1 used in this study (mM range), these data indicate for the first time the potency of an SPM to counteract deleterious processes in OA chondrocytes. MSCs have been demonstrated to be effective in the treatments of different tissue injuries and, in particular, they have been considered as a promising alternative cell source for cartilage repair [156] . However, recent studies have suggested that the beneficial effects of MSCs on injured tissues could be attributed to the activation of a protective mechanism and the stimulation of endogenous regeneration rather than to their differentiation potential [157] . MSC-secreted bioactive molecules and/or EVs may act as paracrine or endocrine mediators that directly activate target cells or neighboring cells to secrete functionally active agents. Indeed, we recently demonstrated the therapeutic potential of ASCs secretome and EVs both in vitro on TNF\\u03b1-stimulated articular chondrocytes [158, 159] , and in vivo in a mouse model of OA [160] , providing evidences of MSC mediated anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory action. Consistently, the influence of MSCs towards PGE 2 gene expression was studied in the pathogenesis of OA. One study showed that MSCs could significantly (p < 0.05) reduce PGE 2 expression in OA synoviocytes after 24 and 48 h co-culture compared to control cells [161] . Moreover, several researches disclosed that MSC-derived EVs stimulate tissue regeneration [162] , and EVs have generally important functions in cell communication and regulation. EVs are home to the inflammatory site and transfer proteins/peptides, mRNA, microRNA, lipids, or organelles with reparative and anti-inflammatory properties [161, 163] . Lipids are essential components of the EVs membranes, and it is well known that specific lipids are enriched in EVs compared to their parent cells. For example, it has been shown a 2-3 times enrichment from cells to EVs for cholesterol, GPLs, and PSs [164, 165] . On the contrarily, EVs generally contained less PCs than their parent cells. At the moment, the physiological importance of the asymmetric lipids distribution between EVs and parent cells is still largely unknown. Compared to the original BMSCs, Xiang et al. found out that MSC-EVs were highly enriched in the cell proliferation and migration mediator S1P by the involvement of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) [166] . In detail, human chondrocytes were co-cultured with MSC-EVs showing enhanced proliferation and decreased apoptosis induced by IL-1\\u03b2, known as one of the main inflammatory mediators for arthritis. The highlighted MSC-EVs therapeutic effect occurs in part through the S1P/S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) signaling pathway activation. So, also this study suggests the implication of lipids and their related pathways (i.e., S1P/S1PR1) into the clinical application of MSC-EVs to the treatment of articular cartilage defect. Future lipidomic research, aimed at characterizing the lipid mediators of the crosstalk among MSCs and other articular cell types (e.g., chondrocytes, synoviocytes, or osteoblasts), would likely uncover additional inflammatory pathways associated with OA, with interesting repercussions in the clinical management of this pathology.In the last few years, lipidomics has gathered the interest of the scientific community because of the recently confirmed role of lipids in several biochemical aspects as first actors. In detail, lipids are recognized as key players in cells membrane and signaling processes, such as inflammation and immunomodulation. Furthermore, cell lipidome changes according to different cell phases and microenvironment features. Therefore, by analyzing differences in profiles of specific lipid species, it is possible to obtain insights regarding lipids interference in cell signaling and other cellular mechanisms. Lipidomics has proved being successful in identifying viable and functional cell cultures, which could guarantee efficient and safe MSCs application. Despite the limited availability of data regarding MSC lipidomics, the pleiotropic biological actions of different lipid families indicate them as promising candidates for future therapeutic interventions. No new data were created or analyzed in this study.

SARS-CoV-2 continuously circulated, even among individuals with preexisting immunity, and since COVID-19 began until the time of writing has caused about 271 million confirmed cases along with 5.2 million deaths worldwide [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) might escape the humoral immune response to natural infection or vaccination [4, 5] , which reinforces the necessity of specific antiviral treatments. After almost a two-year effort in the repurposing of clinically approved drugs, limited benefits for COVID -19 patients have been demonstrated [5] . Thus, it is necessary to improve the pre-clinical characterization of repurposed drugs to rationalize further clinical studies, in terms of posology and susceptibility of VoC, and learn from their interactions with the viral target enzyme.During the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, viral surface glycoprotein spike interacts with human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and with the extracellular protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to enter the cells. Positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA is translated to polyproteins that are auto-cleaved by viral papain-like (PL pro ) and major (M pro ) proteases. These matured non-structural proteins (nsp), such as nsp12/8/7 (RNA polymerase complex), nsp13 (helicase), nsp14/10 (exonuclease and N7-ethyltransferase), nsp15 (endonuclease) and nsp16 (2'-O-methyltransferase), are responsible for RNA replication and transcription of structural genes. These structural genes will be translated, assembled with the newly synthetized genomic RNA and bud as a new virus progeny. These events represent key steps during viral life cycle to potentially limit SARS-CoV-2 replication [6] .We have previously described that atazanavir (ATV, Figure 1 ), a clinically approved human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor [7] , is endowed with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity [8] .

The 2D-and 3D-chemical structure for atazanavir (ATV).Studies reconfirmed, by bioinformatics and basic enzymatic inhibition curves, that ATV targets SARS-CoV-2 major protease (M pro ), an enzyme responsible for the cleavage of 11 sites of the viral polyprotein, a key-step in virus life cycle [13, 14] . The development by Pfizer of PAXLOVID TM (PF-07321332), combined with ritonavir, (Figure S1 , Supplementary Material) showed clinical efficacy in reduce hospitalization by 80%, reconfirming that M pro is a very important druggable target [15] . Thus, other drugs that target this enzyme deserve a more detailed characterization, to provide insight on pharmacophoric regions for next generation of anti-COVID-19 antivirals.Anti-M pro from ATV has been disputed as controversial depending on assay conditions [16] . This apparent paradox reinforces that detailed mechanism of action and robust series of pre-clinical experiments should be conducted to shed light on the ATV inhibitory mechanism and the susceptibility of contemporaneous SARS-CoV-2 strains to this drug. Here, we address additional explanations to controversial effects of ATV on M pro , characterizing it as a competitive inhibitor of this viral enzyme that requires a catalytic water to be effective. ATV possesses anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity against B.1 and gamma strains on Calu-3 cells, a model of type II pneumocytes. ATV reached the plasma and lungs of treated Swiss-Webster mice and protected SARS-CoV-2-infected transgenic mice expression in human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (K18-hACE2) from mortality. Moreover, ATV reduced virus-induced inflammation and cell death in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and lung damage in infected and treated animals. This study compiles pre-clinical results that may allow further rationalization of clinical trials against COVID-19.To advance on details on how ATV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 M pro , we initially performed a dose-dependent inhibition curve. ATV was slightly less potent than the positive control GC376 [17] (Figure 2A ). The Morrison's inhibitory constant (K i ) values for GC376 and ATV were 208 \\u00b1 0.15 and 703 \\u00b1 79 nM, respectively. Next, we tested ATV against various concentrations of M pro substrate. We observed that maximum velocity (V max ) values in the presence and absence of ATV were not different, while the Michaelis-Menten constant (K m ) values increased significantly in the presence of this drug ( Figure 2B ), indicating a competitive inhibition profile. Our results are specific to M pro because, differently from the positive control GRL0617, ATV did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PL pro ) ( Figure 2C ). Since structural improvements on the M pro active site were determined more recently [18, 19] , SARS-CoV-2 molecular docking calculations were carried out to test if a catalytic water (H 2 O cat ) was required for ATV action. Since the highest docking score value was obtained in the presence of H 2 O cat , molecular docking calculations suggested a dependence of ATV potency of water content into the catalytic site of M pro - Figure 2D for M pro and ATV in the presence of H 2 O cat and Figure S2 in the Supplementary Material for the 2D-plot image corresponding to the main amino acid residues which interact with ATV in the absence and presence of H 2 O cat . The GOLD 2020.2 software ranked the ten best docking poses and at analyzing each pose, none of them showed a conformation for the interaction between the pyridyl group of ATV and the catalytic water.The competitive inhibition implies that M pro 's substrate concentration may affect its susceptibility to ATV. Thus, we tested if ATV's potency is also affected in type II pneumocyte cell line (Calu-3) infected with different SARS-CoV-2 MOIs. In cell-based assays, the intracellular concentration of M pro 's substrate would be proportional to the virus input. Indeed, ATV's EC 50 value for the SARS-CoV-2 B.1 lineage varied in a MOIdependent way (Table 1) , similarly to remdesivir (RDV) ( Table 1) , a competitive inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase complex under clinical use [20, 21] . The SARS-CoV-2 gamma VoC is similarly susceptible to ATV, compared to its predecessor strain B.1 (Table 1) . Since the CC 50 values of 312 \\u00b1 8 and 512 \\u00b1 30 \\u00b5M for ATV and RDV, respectively, their selective index (SI) values were consistent with an adequate safety profile in vitro (Table 1) . We first aimed evaluate ATV's pharmacokinetics profile over time in the plasma and lungs of Swiss-Webster mice treated with 60 mg/kg of this drug, a dosage equivalent to its plasma exposure in humans under treatment against HIV. Upon treatment with 60 mg/kg, ATV concentration in the plasma was similar to the standard treatment of 300 mg in humans ( Figure 3A ) [22] . Interestingly, ATV seems to be concentrated in the lung of the treated animals ( Figure 3B ).Next, we infected K18-hACE2-transgenic mice with SARS-CoV-2 gamma VoC and treated them with a daily oral dose of 60 mg/kg ATV, initiating 12 h after infection. Whereas the infection kills all animals within 6 days, a statistically significant increase in animal survival was observed in the infected and ATV-treated mice ( Figure 4A ). ATV We first aimed evaluate ATV's pharmacokinetics profile over time in the plasma and lungs of Swiss-Webster mice treated with 60 mg/kg of this drug, a dosage equivalent to its plasma exposure in humans under treatment against HIV. Upon treatment with 60 mg/kg, ATV concentration in the plasma was similar to the standard treatment of 300 mg in humans ( Figure 3A ) [22] . Interestingly, ATV seems to be concentrated in the lung of the treated animals ( Figure 3B ).Next, we infected K18-hACE2-transgenic mice with SARS-CoV-2 gamma VoC and treated them with a daily oral dose of 60 mg/kg ATV, initiating 12 h after infection. Whereas the infection kills all animals within 6 days, a statistically significant increase in animal survival was observed in the infected and ATV-treated mice ( Figure 4A ). ATV protected the mice to continue to lose weight at the 6th day after infection ( Figure 4B ). In the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the treated animals, ATV significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels ( Figure 4C ), cell death-based on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity ( Figure 4D ATV reduced the SARS-CoV-2-induced IL-6 levels in the BAL and in the lungs of treated animals ( Figure 5 ). In the lung, levels of TNF-\\u03b1 and KC were also reduced in the infected/untreated over untreated mice ( Figure 5 ). These results are in line with our previous description that ATV decreases the levels of SARS-CoV-2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes [8] and virus-triggered pyroptosis [23] . Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection provoked severe lung injury, leading to hemorrhage, and shrinking of the lobe, bronchiole and alveoli (Figure 6 ), which was reduced by ATV. This protection is the consequence of the direct antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of ATV, since this molecule could not prevent hemorrhage as an anti-clotting agent ( Figure S3, Supplementary Material) . and mononuclear cells counts (E) and immunocytochemical staining (F) were assessed in the BAL six days after infection in the indicated experimental groups. All the analysis were performed with 6 mice/group.ATV reduced the SARS-CoV-2-induced IL-6 levels in the BAL and in the lungs of treated animals ( Figure 5 ). In the lung, levels of TNF-\\u03b1 and KC were also reduced in the infected/untreated over untreated mice ( Figure 5 ). These results are in line with our previous description that ATV decreases the levels of SARS-CoV-2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes [8] and virus-triggered pyroptosis [23] . Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection provoked severe lung injury, leading to hemorrhage, and shrinking of the lobe, bronchiole and alveoli (Figure 6 ), which was reduced by ATV. This protection is the consequence of the direct antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of ATV, since this molecule could not prevent hemorrhage as an anti-clotting agent ( Figure S3 Repurposing of clinically approved drugs was considered an accelerated strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections [24, 25] . However, limited clinical benefit has been documented for most repurposed drugs, whereas in the meantime orally available antiviral drugs against COVID-19 demonstrated clinical efficacy to reduce hospitalization, such as molnupiravir [26] and PAXLOVID TM [15] . Molnupiravir and PAXLOVID TM target the viral Repurposing of clinically approved drugs was considered an accelerated strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections [24, 25] . However, limited clinical benefit has been documented for most repurposed drugs, whereas in the meantime orally available antiviral drugs against COVID-19 demonstrated clinical efficacy to reduce hospitalization, such as molnupiravir [26] and PAXLOVID TM [15] . Molnupiravir and PAXLOVID TM target the viral RNA synthesis and M pro , respectively. Besides detailed mechanism of action, these compounds fulfilled pre-clinical steps of investigation, from cell-based to animal models, to allow further clinical development to be conducted at target plasmatic concentration. Here, we performed pre-clinical study steps for ATV by enzymatic, in silico calculations and cell-based assays, combined with animal models ( Figure S4 in the Supplementary Material). The comprehension that ATV inhibits competitively M pro and requires a catalytic water to enhance ATV's interactions ATV onto the catalytic pocket and, more specifically, with residue His-41, which is one of the constituents of the catalytic dyad, may allow further development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 analogs.We originally demonstrated that ATV inhibited SARS-CoV-2 M pro preparations and virus replication [8] . The controversial effects of ATV on SARS-CoV-2 M pro are documented in the literature [13, 15] . In line with studies that demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to ATV, we demonstrated here that M pro was inhibited by this drug, with K i 1.5-fold higher than GC376 and in a competitive fashion, increasing the enzyme's K m more than sixfold. It is unlikely that the other SARS-CoV-2 protease, PL pro , was targeted by ATV in these assays, because its K i for PL pro was above the threshold of in vitro inhibition.The amino acid residue His-41 of M pro requires water to catalyze proteolytic cleavage [18, 19] and ATV targets this moiety. The presence of 20% glycerol in enzyme assay mixture reduces the water content and prevents ATV activity, that is why Ma and Wang [16, 27] could not identify this HIV protease inhibitor as a potential antiviral against COVID-19, whereas Li et al. [13] reached results similarly to ours. Our enzymatic assay includes bovine serum albumin (BSA) to avoid non-specific binding of small molecules to M pro . In our M pro FRET-based enzymatic assay, reactions were allowed to occur overnight to increase the sensitivity, instead of 1 h [16] . Although one might argue that a longer reaction time will increase the rate of false positive results, the following cell-based assays provide an additional layer of evidence that ATV activity against SARS-CoV-2 is credible.Conversely, whereas ATV depends on water and multiple transient interactions, PF-07321332, which demonstrated clinical benefit [15] , was a covalent inhibitor of M pro [28] . Indeed, PF-07321332 directly target a key amino acid residue, the catalytic cysteine 145 [28] . Additionally, differently than in silico results obtained for ATV, the PF-07321332 is more buried into the protease pocket, probably due to the ligand steric area (781.51 and 493.69 \\u00c5 2 for ATV and PF-07321332, respectively) which result in a hydrogen bonding interaction between PF-07321332 and His-163 that is considered as a crucial residue for natural peptidic substrates [28, 29] .Considering the substrate-dependent inhibitory effect of ATV, we hypothesized ATV's potency in cell-based assays would be influenced by varying the virus input, because higher numbers of virus particles should translate into increased quantities of M pro substrate. To test this hypothesis, Calu-3 cells, which is more closely resemble type II pneumocytes than A549 and Vero cells [9, 10] , were infected with a 100-fold different multiplicity of infections (MOI) of SARS-CoV-2, B.1 lineage, and treated with ATV or RDV, a competitive inhibitor of viral RNA synthesis. The MOI-dependent inhibition was consistent for ATV and RDV. The similarity in the cell-based potency of ATV to its K i for M pro further reinforces the conclusion that M pro is the target of ATV in vitro.The emerging Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 gamma variant, initially detected in the state of Amazonas, was responsible for a public health calamity, spreading rapidly in Brazil and considered as one of variant of concern by WHO. The mutations found in gamma variant have been associated with increased transmissibility, higher viral load, propensity for immune evasion and SARS-CoV-2 reinfection [30, 31] . ATV presented adequate inhibitory At plasma exposures similar to humans [22] , ATV enhanced by 30% the survival of K18-hACE2-transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 gamma strain and decreased virusinduced cell death and inflammation. Despite there is not a statical difference in the body weight between the untreated and treated groups, the protective effect of ATV was viewed in relation to the significantly decrease of SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), as well as a significant reduction in the number of mononuclear leukocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and LDH levels. In the BAL infected and treated animals displayed lower levels of IL-6, TNF-a, KC and PF4, compared to untreated mice. The in vivo anti-inflammatory of ATV observed here is in line with the ability of this molecule to inhibit pyroptosis in human primary monocytes for both BAL and lung samples clearly showing that ATV protect both cell death and inflammation [23, 32] .Our study shows that ATV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 M pro with a mechanism of action different than PAXLOVID TM , showing ATV/M pro interface could give insights for further drug development. The in vitro and in vivo results reconfirm, in different magnitudes, SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to ATV. Further ongoing clinical trials will determine if standard dose, used in HIV-treatment can prevent severe COVID-19 or if it is necessary higher doses [33] . According to ATV's monography [22] , doses three times higher could be used for shorter periods of time, when compared to the life-lasting HIV treatment.Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), tris(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)methylium chloride (crystal violet), formaldehyde, hematoxylin, eosin, phosphate buffer solution (PBS), ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ketamine, xylazine, trisodium citrate, calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ) and remdesivir (RDV) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich/Merck (St. Louis, MO, USA). Atazanavir sulfate (ATV) was kindly donated from Instituto de Tecnologia de F\\u00e1rmacos, Farmanguinhos, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.African green monkey kidney (Vero, subtype e6) and human lung epithelial (Calu-3) cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM-HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 \\u00b5g/mL streptomycin (P/S-Thermo Fisher Scientific \\u00ae , Waltham, MA, USA) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS-HyClone, Logan, UT, USA). The cells were incubated at 310 K in 5% of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ).The SARS-CoV-2 B.1 lineage (GenBank #MT710714) and gamma variant (also known as P1 or B.1.1.28 lineage; #EPI_ISL_1060902) were isolated on Vero E6 cells from nasopharyngeal swabs of confirmed cases. All procedures related to virus culture were handled at biosafety level 3 (BSL3) multiuser facility at Funda\\u00e7\\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, according to world health organization (WHO) guidelines [34] .The ATV capacity to inhibit enzymatic velocity of PL pro and M pro from SARS-CoV-2 was determined by the commercial kit provided by BPS Bioscience \\u00ae company (catalog number: #79995-1 and #79955-1, respectively) following the procedure and recommendations from literature and manufacturer [35] [36] [37] . Basically, 100 nM PL pro was incubated in 50 mM HEPES pH 7. KTSAVLQSGFRKME-EDANS with CAS number 730985-86-1) and ATV or GC376 (positive control), at concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 \\u00b5M. Fluorescence signal was measured at an emission wavelength of 460 nm with excitation at 360 nm in a GloMax \\u00ae (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) plate reader. Morrison's inhibitory constant (K i ) was calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism 9. The Michaelis-Menten plot was conducted for 88.8 nM M pro incubated overnight in assay buffer with substrate concentrations varying from 0 to 100 \\u00b5M in the presence and absence of 2.5 \\u00b5M of ATV. After fluorescence quantification, the Michaelis-Menten constant (K m ) and maximum velocity (V max ) were calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism 9. The value was presented as mean \\u00b1 standard deviation (SD).The crystallographic structure of M pro was obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB), with access code 7K40 [38] . The chemical structure for ATV was built and minimized in terms of energy by Density Functional Theory (DFT) via Spartan'18 software (Wavefunction, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) [39] . The molecular docking calculations were performed with GOLD 2020.2 software (Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center Software Ltd., CCDC, Cambridge CB2 1EZ, UK) [40] . Hydrogen atoms were added to the protease following tautomeric states and ionization data, which are inferred by the GOLD 2020.2 software at pH 7.4. The number of genetic operations (crossing, migration, mutation) during the search procedure was set as 100,000. Redocking studies were carried out with the crystallographic ligand boceprevir (PDB code: 7K40), obtaining the lowest root mean square deviation (RMSD) value by ChemPLP function. It was defined 8 \\u00c5 radius around the active binding site and the figures were generated with PyMOL Delano Scientific LLC software (DeLano Scientific LLC: San Carlos, CA, USA) [41] , while the 2D-plot was obtained by ProteinsPlus platform (Zentrum f\\u00fcr Bioinformatik, Universit\\u00e4t Hamburg, Germany) [42] . After 48 h, the supernatants were harvested, and infectious virus titers were quantified by plaque forming assays according to previous publications [8, 43, 44] .To perform the virus titration, Vero cells (2.0 \\u00d7 10 4 cell/well) in 96-well plates (Nalge Nunc Int, Rochester, NY, USA) were infected with log-based dilutions of the yield reduction assays' supernatants for 1 h at 37 \\u2022 C in 5% of CO 2 . After the incubation, medium containing 1.8% CMC with 5% FBS was added and incubated at 37 \\u2022 C with 5% CO 2 for 72 h. The cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde in PBS and stained with a 0.04% solution of crystal violet in 70% methanol. The virus titers were calculated by scoring the plaque-forming unit-(PFU/mL) and a non-linear regression analysis of the dose-response curves was also performed to calculate the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ). All experiments were carried out at least three independent times, including a minimum of two technical replicates in each assay, and each data was analyzed from Prism GraphPad software 8.0 (Windows GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The value was presented as mean \\u00b1 standard deviation (SD).Vero cells (2.0 \\u00d7 10 4 cell/well) were treated for 3 days with different concentrations of ATV or RDV (ranging from 1 to 600 \\u00b5M) as previously described by us [8, 44] . The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) was calculated by a non-linear regression analysis from a dose-response curve. All experiments were carried out at least three independent times and each data was analyzed from Prism GraphPad software 8.0 (Windows GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The results were presented as mean \\u00b1 standard deviation (SD). The selectivity indexes (SI) for ATV and RDV were calculated through the ratio between CC 50 and EC 50 values.ATV's concentration in the plasma and lungs of adult Swiss-Webster mice (8-15 weeks) was evaluated over time. Animals were treated with an oral dose of 60 mg/kg of ATV for 12-time intervals-00:05, 00:10, 00:20, 00:40, 01:00, 02:00, 03:00, 04:00, 06:00, 08:00, 10:00 and 12:00 h. Each treatment group had five animals. After these periods of times, total blood and lungs were collected. Plasma was obtained by blood centrifugation at 8000\\u00d7 g for 15 min. Experiments with transgenic mice expressing human ACE-2 receptor (K18-hACE2mice), were performed in Animal Biosafety Level 3 (ABSL-3) multiuser facility, according to the animal welfare guidelines of the Ethics Committee of Animal Experimentation (CEUA-INCa, License 005/2021) and WHO guidelines [34] . The animals were obtained from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation breeding colony and maintained with free access to food and water at 29-30 \\u2022 C under a controlled 12 h light/dark cycle. Experiments were performed during the light phase of the cycle.For infection procedures, mice were anaesthetized with 60 mg/kg of ketamine and 4 mg/kg of xylazine and inoculated intranasally with DMEM high glucose (MOCK), or 10 5 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 gamma strain in 10 \\u00b5L of DMEM high glucose. It was used six mice per experimental group: MOCK (non-infected); SARS-CoV-2-infected without treatment (NIL) and SARS-CoV-2-infected and treated with ATV. The animals were treated with a daily dose of 60 mg/kg of ATV for seven days.The animals were monitored daily during seven days for survival and body-weight analysis. In the case of weight loss higher than 20% euthanasia was performed to alleviate animal suffering. In the last day, the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from both lungs was harvested by washing the lungs once with 1 mL of cold PBS. After centrifugation of BAL (1500 rpm for 5 min), the pellet was used for total and differential leukocytes counts (diluted in Turk's 2% acetic acid fluid) using a Neubauer chamber. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) quantification was performed with centrifuged BAL supernatant to evaluated cell death (CytoTox96, Promega). Differential cell counts were performed by cytospin (Cytospin3; centrifugation of 350\\u00d7 g for 5 min at room temperature) and stained by the May-Gr\\u00fcnwald-Giemsa method.After BAL harvesting, lungs were perfused with 20 mL of saline solution to remove the circulating blood. Lungs were then collected, pottered and homogenized in 500 \\u00b5L of a phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktail Complete, mini EDTA-free Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany) for 30 s, using an Ultra-Turrax Disperser T-10 basic IKA (Guangzhou, China).The viral RNA from samples collected in the in vivo assays was quantified through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Total RNA was extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), according to manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using Quanti Tect Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) in a StepOne Plus\\u2122 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Amplifications were carried out in 15 \\u00b5L reaction mixtures containing 2\\u00d7 reaction mix buffer, 50 \\u00b5M of each primer, 10 \\u00b5M of the probe and 5 \\u00b5L of RNA template. Primers, probes and cycling conditions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol were used to detect the SARS-CoV-2 (CDC 2020). Amplification of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a reference for the number of cells. The cycle threshold (CT) values for this target were compared to those obtained with different cell quantities (10 7 to 10 2 ), for calibration.The levels of IL-6, TNF-\\u03b1, KC and PF4 were quantified in BAL samples from uninfected (MOCK), infected without treatment (NIL) and infected and treated animals by ELISA, using specific kits and following the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems). Cell death was determined according to the activity of LDH in the BAL as previously described in the Section 4.8.Histological features related to the injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed in the lungs of K18-hACE2 mice. Inflammatory and vascular infiltrates and evidence of cell degeneration was evaluated to characterize the level of the tissue damage. The collected material was fixed with formaldehyde (4%), dehydrated and embedded in paraffin to the obtention of tissue slices through the use of a microtome. The slices were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for microphotographs analysis.Human blood samples were collected from healthy donors in 3.8% trisodium citrate (9:1, v/v), and platelet-poor plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Plasma (100 \\u00b5L) was incubated with 1 \\u00b5L of ATV at various concentrations (diluted in DMSO) for 2 min at 310 K. Plasma clotting was initiated by the addition of 100 \\u00b5L of 25 mM CaCl 2 , and the time for clot formation was recorded on a KC-4 Delta coagulometer (Tcoag, Wicklow, Ireland). Time for clot formation was recorded in triplicates.The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/ 10.3390/ph15010021/s1, Figure S1 : Chemical structure for (A) PF-07321332 and (B) ritonavir, the active principles of PAXLOVID TM from Pfizer.

The second challenge was to identify the main stakeholders and their strategies to address different COVID-19 countermeasures.The empirical research is based on a large pool of data. The data was collected on four routes in France where competition was expected for train services in 2020, in line with market liberalization. Notably, because the COVID-19 crisis was not anticipated, the initial purpose of the data collection was to assess the effect of train liberalization on the current train market as well as on the other modes of transport in terms of price and frequency.Consequently, the data collection started in September 2019 and was still active in December 2021 for four modes: coach, carpooling, 1 train, and air. The analysis is based on time series from September 2019 to October 2021. Prices and frequencies are discussed as the main variables on an aggregated scale for all modes then mode per mode.Finally, the intensity of the competition is analyzed on two scales: intramodal and intermodal. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is used to assess the level of competition through market concentration (Lipczynski et al., 2017) .The main results have to be considered carefully as the pandemic is ongoing as of the end of 2021. However, the progress of the vaccination programs in Europe and France during the second part of 2021 suggests a return to a normal state of the market. The first finding was the severe crisis in terms of supply during the first lockdown in March 2020. Throughout the rest of 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 countermeasures had progressively less impact, and services increased slowly, with rail and carpooling recovering to a level similar to their 2019 levels. However, thisis not yet the case for coach and air services. The second finding is that the market is concentrated to the advantage of the dominant mode, rail services, especially in comparison to air services, which are the main challenger for long-distance trips. Air services still face difficulties recovering, mainly because of reduction in the business market.The third finding highlights the persistence of conventional services during the different lockdowns and the high variability of low-cost services, which disappeared during the crisis. However, no operator went bankrupt or left the market during the crisis, mainly thanks to public support. Moreover, low-cost services recovered faster in September-October 2021 than conventional services, thereby increasing their market share. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in greater intramodal competition, mainly between the incumbent and challengers in each mode. The last finding reveals the crisis in the business market (Caputo et al., 2021) caused by alternatives to business travel (such as videoconferencing and teleworking). This crisis may explain the challenges conventional services face when confronted by low-cost services better adapted to the leisure market. Additionally, it suggests a new paradigm of work and travel based on the development of alternatives to physical mobility. It confirms the concept of a \\\"new normal\\\" and questions public national incumbents' business models, which are traditionally dependent on business users.There are several practical implications for policymakers and operators. First, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the key role public national incumbents play during a crisis in ensuring a minimal service when other operators stop running as well as providing specific services, like sanitary trains in France. Second, there is a risk that the end of public financial support will transform the long-distance transport market into \\\"business for survival\\\" as the sector is highly sensitive to COVID-19 countermeasures and has become more competitive, mainly because of reduced demand (especially from the business market). Finally, most of the market segments are duopolies, so there is a high risk of monopolies developing if challenger operators go bankrupt. Public regulators must remain vigilant in the immediate future regarding the effects of COVID-19 countermeasures and public financial support to avoid greater market concentration. This paper is structured in six sections. Section 2 presents the motivations underlying the French case and the context for long-distance services. Section 3 describes the data collection and method. Section 4 gives the general results, after which Section 5 discusses them mode by mode. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.There are several reasons for selecting France as a case study. First, the French market is characterized by a wide variety of services for long-distance travel, from rail services to carpooling, as described in Subsection 2.1. Subsection 2.2 shows that during the pandemic, France, like other European countries, imposed strict sanitary regulations and multiple lockdowns as well as other restrictions, affecting long-distance travel. Finally, Subsection 2.3 highlights the crisis's severe impact on demand for travel and transport companies.The French case is interesting due to the wide choice of transport services available on long-distance routes. Laroche and Lamatkhanova (2021) showed that the diversity of services in the French market is similar to Germany's, Italy's, and the UK's. The services are predominantly train, coach, carpooling, and air. Consequently, analyzing the French market can offer insights into trends in other markets after considering certain specificities of the French market.First, most segments of the long-distance travel market are either duopolies or monopolies. Second, some of them are quite new and were still consolidating when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Third, low-cost services are well established in the market.More specifically, train services are still a monopoly run by the national incumbent, SNCF. The initial competitors were expected in 2020, but the first lockdown and other countermeasures delayed project until the end of 2021.However, the high-speed market can be characterized as an innovative service, because SNCF was the first European operator to develop the concept of low-cost high-speed services (called Ouigo) in 2013. It is interesting to distinguish low-cost services (Ouigo) from traditional services (inOui) and analyze the internal competition between the two. Air services are a duopoly for long-distance trips (journeys that are three hours longer by rail) and a monopoly for shorter trips. The national incumbent is traditionally Air France, which competes with easyJet. The coach market is relatively new in France in so far as it has only been open to competition since 2015 (Blayac & Bougette, 2017) . One of the first players was Flixbus. There were several competitors in the early years but, confronted by the consolidation of the market, most are now limited to niche markets. There were two main competitors at the beginning of 2020 before the first lockdown: Flixbus and BlaBlaBus. BlaBlaBus can be considered a challenger, and its history is original. Launched by the national train company (SNCF) in 2014 (as iDBUS), the company was bought by BlaBlaCar, the French leader in carpooling services, in 2019 with the aim of becoming a multimodal actor in the passenger transport market. Lastly, BlaBlaCar is a carpooling services success story in France and Europe. Established in 2006, it boasted 100 million members in 2021 (Business Insider France, 2021).The next sections consider the effect of COVID-19 on transport overall and on each of the four modes individually.Another motivating factor to examine the French case is the French government's decision to counter COVID-19 with a wide range of regulations. Figure 1 illustrates the chronology of these regulations from 2020 to 2021.The first lockdown was imposed in March 2020, some days after Italy but in line with the majority of other European countries. For eight weeks-from March 17, 2020, to May 11, 2020-mobility was curtailed to one hour per day within a one kilometer radius of one's residence with a pass. From May 11, 2020, to May 28, 2020, the restrictions on local mobility were loosened but stayed restrictive for long-distance mobility, with journeys limited to 100 kilometers for essential reasons only. Long-distance transport services were particularly impacted by these F I G U R E 1 Timeline of the COVID-19 countermeasures in France. Source: Author restrictions. Summer 2020 was unique for several reasons. On the surface, it looked like a \\\"normal\\\" summer; however, the public were obliged to wear masks in public, including on transport, potentially negatively impacting longdistance services. In addition, the limitation of international trips and the rising \\\"fear of social contact\\\" changed mobility behaviors and habits that summer, especially regarding long-distance journeys. The COVID-19 countermeasures of summer 2020 (a lower level of restriction but permanent sanitary regulations, such as the use of masks) persisted until early September, when universities reopened their doors and invited students to travel long distances to be physically present in the classroom after six months of online courses. Unfortunately, the number of COVID-19 cases increased drastically that autumn, leading the French government to implement the second lockdown from October 30, 2020, to December 15, 2020. Prior to the second lockdown, there was a period of curfews from nine p.m. until six p.m. in the most infected localities.The second lockdown was similar to the first. Trips were limited to one kilometer from one's residence for one hour a day with a pass. Additionally, a curfew throughout mainland France was implemented from six p.m. Once again, long-distance services were deeply impacted. Universities closed their doors until summer 2021, and teleworking became the norm for millions of workers. Although the second lockdown was lifted in December 2020, restrictions remained very strict throughout winter 2021, with the national six p.m. curfew and the closure of restaurants, bars, and ski resorts. The third lockdown was ordered from April 3, 2021, to May 3, 2021. Since then, the restrictions have been progressively alleviated, and the curfew ended on June 30, 2021. Summer 2021 was characterized by the permanence of restrictions, like mask-wearing, and the introduction of a vaccination pass, excluding non-vaccinated people from certain modes of transport (air and train), restaurants, and other places. ByOctober 2021, 70% of the French population had been vaccinated against COVID-19, making it possible to return to \\\"normal\\\" life. The mass teleworking policy was removed, and universities reopened. This research compares autumn 2021 to September-October 2019 to assess the effects of eighteen months of restrictions and verify if a \\\"new normal\\\" has emerged from this period.To conclude, long-distance services have been particularly impacted by the different measures to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. This is because long-distance trips were prohibited for many months for the majority of the French population, plus the closure of universities and mass teleworking resulted in no demand from the student and business markets.This last subsection highlights the effect of COVID-19 on demand for long-distance transport services. It also compares the French trends to the European averages. From a general point of view, the collapse in demand for long-distance transport services in France is similar to the rest of Europe. For France's train market, demand decreased by 41% in 2020 compared to 2019 and by 48% on average in Europe (IRG-Rail, 2021). The situation was similar for air, with a decrease of 67% for Air France and \\\"only\\\" 46% for easyJet. The average in Europe was slightly higher with a decrease of 73% in 2020 compared to 2019 (Eurostat, 2021) . For both modes, teleworking and fewer business travelers deeply impacted the overall dynamic (Caputo et al., 2021) .For coach services, demand decreased by 65% over the period (Autorit\\u00e9 de R\\u00e9gulation des Transports, 2021b).Carpooling services were less affected by the collapse in demand than other modes of transport with \\\"only\\\" a 25% reduction in demand (V\\u00e9rier, 2021) . It is possible that the user profile for carpooling is less sensitive to COVID-19 because of age or another factor.Finally, it is interesting to consider that traffic on France's high-speed roads increased by 7.6% during summer 2021 compared to summer 2019 according to Vinci Autoroute (Investir, 2021) . This finding suggests that long-distance trips experienced a similar behavioral change as urban mobility, where an increase in car use has been observed (Klein et al., 2021; Macharis, 2021) .Subsection 3.1 presents the study's parameters. Details of the data collection are described in Subsection 3.2, and Subsection 3.3 explains the method.The analysis is based on four main routes in France as shown in Figure 2 : Paris-Lyon, Paris-Bordeaux, Paris-Toulouse, and Paris-Nice.The initial research question was about the effect of a new competitor on long-distance train travel; therefore, these four routes were selected because a new train operator was expected to challenge the incumbent in the context of market liberalization in 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the introduction of competition and necessitated changing the research question.The four routes were also chosen in the hope of including routes with different characteristics, like travel time.Lyon and Bordeaux are less than three hours from Paris, while Toulouse and Nice are more than three hours from the capital. Consequently, the Toulouse and Nice are served by more flights but fewer trains and other services, like carpooling and coaches. Moreover, the Paris-Lyon route is one of the most used high-speed lines in Europe, serving more than 44 million travelers in 2019.F I G U R E 2 Study parameters. Source: AuthorData were collected every Tuesday since September 2019 on each route and for four modes of transport: train, air, coach, and carpooling. Tuesday was selected for its representativeness during the week. The collection was performed one week before the departure date except for carpooling because of the high variation of supply at the last minute. In this case, collection was performed one day before to consider more than 90% of the supply.The data collection concerned each mode and each service (only direct travel without connections) during the day, and looked at price, schedule, and travel time. In total, the data cover 87 days and comprise more than 14,000 observations 2 between September 2019 and October 2021.The main sources given in Table 1 are the websites dedicated to the different modes. Most of them are comparators because of the competition between operators. The two exceptions are for train and carpooling where the markets are monopolies. For rail, we used the SNCF's commercial website where all the train offerings are presented. For carpooling, there are several operators but only one drives the market; therefore, BlaBlaCar's website was the reference for carpooling. For the other modes, comparators were used. For air, Google Flights gave a full overview of supply, while the European website Omio.fr was used for coach services.The method is based on time series and a descriptive analysis. The times series are given from September 2019 to October 2021. The variations between 2019 and 2021 are calculated on the basis of two reference months:September and October.The main variables used to give an overview of the market evolution are price, number of seats, and number of services (frequency).The price is given as an average price per kilometer for each mode or service. The number of seats is given per day for each mode and service. It is based on the number of seats per service and their frequency during the day.The number of seats can change from one service to another according to its characteristics. This is especially true for train services. For example, a low-cost service proposes 634 seats versus 510 for a conventional high-speed rail service (Autorit\\u00e9 de R\\u00e9gulation des Transports, 2021a). There is less heterogeneity for the other modes. The standard number of seats for a coach service is 50, 3 165 for a standard Airbus A320, 4 and four at most per car for a car.Finally, the frequency is based on the number of services a day.Competition is assessed via the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. It is a well-known index usually used to assess a market's concentration (Lipczynski et al., 2017) . It is based on each operator's market share. In this study, the 2 One observation corresponds to one service one way for one schedule.3 https://location.flixbus.fr/services/location-bus-places#:$:text=Location%20de%20bus%2036%20%2D%2050,bus%20qu'il%20vous%20faut. 4 https://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/airbus-a320/2-les-nombreux-heritiers-de-l-a320/#:$:text=L'A320%2C%20qui%20se%20d%C3%A9cline, hauteur%20de%2011%2C76%20m%C3%A8tres. Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is calculated on the basis of the number of seats for each mode or type of service per day. It is the best indicator to give a realistic view of the level of concentration within a market taking into account the capacity of each mode and frequency of the services.The results are split into two sections. Subsection 4.1 gives an overview of the COVID-19 effects in terms of price and capacity, while Subsection 4.2 focuses on the effects of the pandemic on each mode of transport.The the market (respectively, 0.4% and 2.2% in 2019), rail increased its market share, while air services fell from 17% in 2019 to 13% in 2021. The first lockdown was very severe for air services, when the market share dropped to 4.6% before recovering to around 11% during the two other lockdowns. Nevertheless, the situation remains difficult for air services. For the other modes, it is interesting to consider that carpooling has been more consistent than the other modes with a modal share between 0.4% and 0.2%. However, coach services have been significantly impacted with the stoppage of services during the second and third lockdowns, resulting in rail services taking a greater share of the market.According to Figure 5 , the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index increased by 9.8% over the period, with a peak during the first lockdown, placing the rail incumbent in a dominant position within the market. Figure 6 shows that rail can be observed, especially for coach services, who are well known for their flexibility, but also for rail and air. To conclude, the return of rail services to their initial capacity may hide a lower utilization rate of rail than in 2019. This situation could limit the market power of rail services, particularly in terms of prices.Regarding price, COVID-19 has had unexpected effects. Figure 7 the modes. They decreased during the first and second lockdowns but increased during the third. This can be explained by the significant reduction in supply and state financial support to maintain a minimal service during the first two lockdowns. Concerning train services, it is interesting that the average price per kilometer was similar to that for carpooling. It can provide from the development of the low-cost offer whose the extinction can have a positive effect of prices (increase) as during the three lockdowns. Nevertheless, it is notable that the train incumbent did not benefit from its dominant position within the market by increasing prices. Regarding carpooling prices, the reduction could be related to the price of oil, which dropped in 2020 (INSEE, 2020) . Prices should increase in the next month as oil prices rise. Finally, coach services increased their prices after their services were paused during the lockdowns. Subsection 4.2 highlights the sector's difficulties in finding economic equilibrium.This subsection focuses on each mode's prices and frequency.Rail services can be split into two types: the conventional high-speed rail service (inOui) and the low-cost high-speed rail service (Ouigo). From a general standpoint, Figure 9 shows that the first lockdown dramatically impacted both services. The conventional high-speed rail service almost completely stopped its services, reducing them from an average of 13 trains per day to two, while the low-cost services stopped running altogether. The effect of the subsequent two lockdowns was less severe, although both times traffic was halved, and the low-cost services were more impacted than the conventional high-speed rail trains. However, the low-cost services' market share increased significantly from 2019 to 2021. The average number of conventional high-speed rail trains per day decreased by almost 15% but the number of low-cost high-speed rail trains increased by 30%. The result was a substitution of F I G U R E 8 Detailed price per mode (in \\u20ac per km). Source: Author conventional high-speed rail services for low-cost high-speed rail services and a bigger market share for low-cost high-speed rail (from 22% in 2019 to 30% in 2021). The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index decreased by 10% during the period, pointing to greater competition between the two services and a form of internal \\\"home-made\\\" competition.Concerning prices for train services, analysis is difficult because of yield management practices. Figure 10 shows that prices seemed to be more sensitive to the summer holidays than the lockdowns. Nevertheless, it is interesting to observe that prices decreased by 17% and 16%, respectively, for conventional high-speed rail and low-cost highspeed rail between 2019 and 2021. This result was unexpected in so far as the concentration of the market increased in favor of rail services during that period. At least two explanations can be given. First, the overall reduced demand generated overcapacity and put pressure on prices. This is clear for the conventional high-speed rail where frequency and prices were reduced during the period. The severe crisis in the business market linked to teleworking and videoconferencing is an explanation. Second, the train market was opened to competition in 2020. With two years of delay, the first competitors should enter the market at the end of 2021. From this perspective, the incumbent has an interest in moderating prices for conventional high-speed rail services and improving its low-cost services in order to be competitive.Air services are split between two operators. The national company, Air France, traditionally runs conventional services in opposition to easyJet, the well-known low-cost company. As shown in Figure 11 , the first lockdown had whereas easyJet's only dropped by 14%. The market share for low-cost services increased from 30% in October 2019 to 40% in October 2021, and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index fell by 8%, pointing to a higher level of competition within the market. As with conventional rail services, Air France's difficulties in returning to its initial level may be a sign of crisis in the business market, whereas easyJet is in a better situation thanks to its strong position in the leisure market supported by its low-price policy.Regarding prices, as with rail, yield management practices limit the analysis, especially during the lockdowns.However, Figure 12 highlights a strong divergence between Air France's and easyJet's strategies. Between 2019 and 2021, Air France increased its prices by 9%, while easyJet decreased theirs by 50%. As reported in Figure 12 , easyJet has an aggressive strategy of increasing supply and decreasing prices, while Air France seems to have difficulties in keeping its offerings competitive. To conclude, the low-cost services seem to have increased their market share after two years of COVID-19. This last point will be discussed further in Section 5. Figure 12. The coach market is characterized by a duopoly between two companies: Flixbus and BlaBlaBus. Whereas for rail and air services it is possible to distinguish a conventional company from a low-cost one, this is not the case for the Figure 13 presents these characteristics. Both operators adopted a similar strategy during the three lockdowns with a shutdown of their services. Flixbus had a small advantage between the second and the third lockdown as it remained alone on the market. From a general standpoint, Flixbus seems to have performed better between 2019 and 2021 than BlaBlaBus.In 2019, BlaBlaBus had a greater market share than Flixbus (49% versus 38%, respectively), but the situation reversed in September-October 2021 when Flixbus had 62% of the market versus BlaBlaBus's 18%. However, it is important to note that the frequencies are highly variable and sensitive to demand. According to Blayac and Bougette (2020) , this is a competitive advantage inherent in their business model. It can be defined as a two-sided market (Rochet & Tirole, 2003) based on a digital platform where the offer (coach companies' services) matches demand. Both companies have no buses of their own, meaning they are able to adapt their capacity and prices to meet demand. The carpooling market is unique for several reasons. First, there is only one operator for long-distance trips,BlaBlaCar. Other platforms tried to develop alternative services without success. Since 2021, BlaBlaCar can be considered the dominant digital platform for carpooling services. Second, BlaBlaCar is a digital platform where car drivers are free to share their trip and fix their price according to a limit set by the platform (calculated on the distance and based on gasoline price and tolls). Economically speaking, BlaBlaCar's business model can be defined as a two-sided market with a strong position in the long-distance market. Consequently, Figure 15 does not show planned conventional offerings but the results of an aggregate of drivers willing to share their trips. The offerings are very varied, and the peaks are strongly dependent on the holiday periods during winter (Christmas) and summer.The COVID-19 pandemic had two interesting effects on supply. First, traffic stopped during the first lockdown and significantly decreased during the other two. Second, drivers' behavior seems to have changed between 2020 and 2021. Although summer 2020 saw a classic peak, summer 2021 showed below-usual performance levels, and the overall supply fell by 6% between 2019 and 2021. The first explanation could be the simple evolution of the demand for transportation. Considering that the carpooling offer is dependent on the willingness of drivers to make trips, the carpooling supply is certainly the best indicator for assessing the level of demand for long-distance transport. Consequently, it is possible to assume that demand decreased between 2019 and 2021, especially in the leisure market. This could also explain the reduction in supply for other modes. The second explanation can be linked to the fear of social contact. This psychological effect of COVID-19, based on the fear of being infected, has been identified F I G U R E 1 5 Carpooling frequency (average number of cars per day). Source: Author F I G U R E 1 6 Average carpooling price per kilometer (per day). Source: Author regarding other modes of transport (Aaditya & Rahul, 2021) . Finally, the last assumption is based on gasoline prices.They decreased during 2020 before increasing in summer 2021. As the value of drivers' time is very high because of the cost of organizing the services, it is possible that the service has become less attractive to drivers. Figure 16 supports this hypothesis. Prices dropped by 26% throughout the period, before increasing in October 2021. If prices are linked to the price of gasoline, they did not change significantly during the summer when oil prices were already increasing.This last section discusses two further aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-distance services. Subsection 5.1proposes a spatial approach based on an analysis of seat capacities route by route. Subsection 5.2 further questions the results regarding the increase of low-cost services.In Section 4, the results were analyzed by mode of transport. In this section, the objective is to provide an analysis per route to identify the potential spatial effect of COVID-19 countermeasures in France. We recall that the data is based on the following four routes: Paris-Lyon, Paris-Bordeaux, Paris-Toulouse, and Paris-Nice. Each route has specific characteristics. First, distance is a key parameter for distinguishing them. Lyon and Bordeaux are closer to Paris (466 kilometers and 586 kilometers, respectively) than Toulouse and Nice (677 kilometers and 933 kilometers, respectively). A second characteristic is the metropolitan population. Lyon is the biggest (1.3 million inhabitants), Bordeaux and Toulouse are similar (749,595 and 783,353 inhabitants, respectively), and Nice is the smallest (550,000 inhabitants). Finally, their accessibility is heterogenic. Lyon and Bordeaux are directly linked to Paris by a high-speed line, while Toulouse and Nice are still outside the high-speed rail network. Consequently, the travel time by train to these destinations is longer, and air services to them are more developed. Considering this, it is interesting to compare these routes and identify the potential effect of COVID-19 on seat capacities. Figure 17 highlights the effect of COVID-19 on seat capacities for the four routes. The first comment is the effect of distance on seat capacities. The Paris-Lyon route is the shortest and offers the highest number of seats.The considerable difference in 2019 with Bordeaux can be explained by the fact that Lyon is larger than Bordeaux.Otherwise, Toulouse and Nice are similar in terms of supply. Toulouse has a small advantage due to its closer proximity to Paris and bigger metropolitan area. The results are in line with the standard theory of the gravity model (Hansen, 1959) . Concerning the effect of COVID-19, the reduction in the number of seats was similar for Lyon and Bordeaux (\\u00c073% and \\u00c072%, respectively) but very different for Toulouse and Nice (\\u00c051% and \\u00c090%, respectively).In this case, it is difficult to draw a general conclusion. The second lockdown had less of an impact than the first but that is highly heterogenic according to location. The effect of the latter lockdown was unexpected with a stronger effect on short distances (respectively, \\u00c054% for Lyon and \\u00c052% for Bordeaux) and a lower effect on longer distances (respectively \\u00c034% for Toulouse and \\u00c026% for Nice). Finally, all the destinations lost seat capacity in September-October 2021 in comparison to 2019. Nevertheless, the two shortest distances lost less capacity than the two others. Lyon and Bordeaux reduced their seat capacities by 5.7% and 9.5%, respectively, while Toulouse and Nice reduced them by 17.5% and 18%, respectively. The higher reduction for the latter two can be attributed to the difficulties air services faced in returning to their initial level of service. Furthermore, the better performance of Lyon and Bordeaux can be linked to the good performance of rail services as discussed in Section 4. To conclude, the cities that are not linked to the high-speed rail network or who are far from the main city (more than three hours away) have suffered more from the effect of COVID-19 than the others in terms of supply.The aforementioned results highlighted a possible increase in low-cost services for rail and air modes between 2019 and 2021. This last section tests this finding. Figure 18 compares the evolution of conventional and low-cost supplies for air and rail in terms of frequency. In September and October 2019, there were on average 120 conventional trains and flights per day for the routes investigated and 30 low-cost trains and flights. The modal share of low-cost services was around 25%. The first lockdown had a dramatic effect on both traditional and low-cost services but impacted low-cost services more. All lowcost air and rail services stopped, whereas conventional services were merely reduced. The two other lockdowns had less impact on overall traffic. However, low-cost services were still more affected than conventional ones. During the second lockdown, frequency decreased by 42% for conventional services versus 82% for low-cost services.During the last lockdown, the decrease was 38% for conventional services versus 52% for low-cost services. This confirms the greater flexibility of low-cost services, although in the case of serious crisis, the pursual of the service offer has been guaranted of service continuity.In September-October 2021, there were on average 34 low-cost services a day versus 87 for the conventional offer. There are several lessons here. First, the number of low-cost services did not increase by much (+5.5%). They regained their pre-COVID-19 levels. Second, the full service offer decreased by 28.5% over the period. Traditional air and rail services remain are far below their initial level with only 87 services per day versus 120 in 2019.F I G U R E 1 8 Average low-cost offer for rail and air per route and day versus the full service offer. Source: Author Consequently, the low-cost market share increased, but the analysis confirms that there has not been an overall increase in low-cost services. There appear to be more low-cost services because the conventional offer is still far below its initial level.To conclude, Figure 19 shows the ratio between low-cost services and conventional services for rail and air to the previous results were driven by one or the other. For both air and rail, the ratio was higher in 2021 than in 2019, which confirms the previous results. If the ratio were higher in 2019 for air, signifying a larger market share for lowcost services than for rail, it was the opposite in 2021. However, the ratio for air almost returned to the difference with rail in 2021, illustrating easyJet's aggressive strategy. It also confirms the severe crisis conventional services, traditionally driven by business trips, face (Caputo et al., 2021 ). An analysis of demand and supply would be an interesting addition to this research to further explore the effect of COVID-19 on the evolution of travel behaviors.The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the implementation of strict regulations all over the world, an unprecedented development in peacetime. These regulations significantly impacted long-distance transportation by limiting individuals' capacity to travel both between countries and within them. At the same time, behaviors changed to adapt to the lack of physical mobility, such as the rise of teleworking and videoconferencing. This study examined the effects of these regulations on long-distance transport services. France was selected as the case study because of the difficulty in obtaining international data and the country's large variety of services (rail, air, coach, and carpooling) as well as its representativeness in terms of COVID-19 countermeasures (including three lockdowns).There are several main findings, but these must be considered with caution because the pandemic, at the time of writing in November 2021, is ongoing. The first finding is the severe crisis in terms of supply during the first lockdown in March 2020. The subsequent COVID-19 countermeasures and lockdowns during the rest of 2020 and 2021 had progressively less impact on long-distance transport, and services increased slowly until rail and carpooling services were close to their 2019 levels (though coach and air services have not yet recovered to this point).The second finding is that the market is concentrated to the advantage of the dominant mode, rail services. Air services are the main challenger for long-distance trips but face difficulties in recovering their activity mainly because of the reduction in business travel.The last finding highlights the persistence of conventional services during the different lockdowns and the high variability of low-cost services, which disappeared during the crisis. However, it is interesting to consider two facts.F I G U R E 1 9 The ratio of low-cost services to classic services for train and air. Source: Author First, no operator went bankrupt during the crisis or withdrew from a route, mainly thanks to state financial support.Second, low-cost services were recovering faster in September-October 2021 than conventional services, finally increasing their market share in the air, rail, and coach markets. The crisis in the business market can explain the difficulty for conventional services confronted by low-cost ones better adapted to the leisure market. In addition, the effect is higher intramodal competition predominantly between the incumbent and challengers in each mode. Finally, the spatial approach highlights the greater resilience of long-distance travel services serving cities connected to the high-speed rail network that are close to the main cities. The cities that are not linked to the high-speed rail network or that are far from the main city (more than three hours away) have suffered more from the effects of COVID-19 than the others in terms of supply.The results show that the concept of a \\\"new normal\\\" could be applied to the French long-distance travel market considering the structural reduction of the business market. It suggests a new paradigm of work and mobility based on the development of alternatives to physical mobility (such as videoconferencing and teleworking). Moreover, the shrinking business market presents a huge challenge for the public national incumbents (SNCF, Air France) because their business models depend on business users.There are several practical implications for policymakers and operators. First of all, the COVID-19 crisis highlights the key role public national incumbents play during a crisis to ensure a minimum level of service when other operators stop their activities. They also played a key role in providing specific services, like sanitary trains in France.Second, there is a risk that the end of the state financial support will transform long-distance travel business into \\\"business for survival\\\" as the sector is highly sensitive to the effects of COVID-19 countermeasures and is still weakened by the reduction of the business market. Furthermore, most of the market segments are duopolies. There is a risk of monopolies developing should an operator go bankrupt. The public regulators must remain vigilant in the next few months regarding the effect of COVID-19 countermeasures and state financial support to avoid higher concentration within the markets. Finally, the current market evolution with fewer air services could be an interesting trend for the future, considering the objective of carbon neutrality in France and Europe by 2050. The reduction of the business market can be a relevant lever for at least two reasons. First, it may be easier to find alternatives to physical travel (such as videoconferencing) for business trips than for leisure or family trips. Second, business demand prioritizes frequency over price. A reduction of the business segment could favor fewer trains and flights per day but conversely a better utilization rate and commercial capacity thanks to the low-cost model, leading to environmental benefits.https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9961-1159\",\n          \"The lipidome is defined as the complete set of lipids present within a cell, a tissue, or an organism [1, 2] . In the last decades, it has become clear that the lipidome, as well as the transcriptome and the proteome, is in a dynamic balance and it can be affected by physio-pathological conditions, stimuli, and changes in diet [3, 4] . Lipidomics is a relatively new \\\"-omics\\\" that characterizes, identifies, and quantifies the lipidome and its metabolic pathways and other networks that are involved within different biological mechanisms [5] . With analytical approaches, such as thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and gas chromatography (GC), lipidomics was able to develop new diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies [6] ; but it was with the advent of the next-generation mass spectrometry (MS) that there have been significant advances in the field of lipidomics [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In a typical lipidomic workflow, lipids are extracted from the biological matrices using organic solvents and analyzed by direct infusion into a mass spectrometer (technique known as \\\"shotgun\\\" lipidomics), or separated by liquid (LC) or gas chromatography (GC), prior to detection by MS. These two approaches are complementary, since the \\\"shotgun\\\" method allows a larger lipid profiling by simultaneous identification of several classes of lipids, meanwhile LC or GC/MS enable a more targeted analysis with the detection of structurally similar lipids belonging to a single class [12] [13] [14] . In both methods, the quantification is performed using a ratio against internal standard(s), which is routinely added for sample normalization and matrix effect influence correction. Internal standard structures and physicochemical properties are representative of the endogenous lipid species of interest and are added at the earliest possible step during sample preparation. For shotgun lipidomics, a semiquantification is generally possible by using exogenous lipids representative of the main lipid classes of interest; whereas for targeted lipidomics, labeled lipids (i.e., deuterated internal standards) should be included for absolute quantification. In the last few years, the aforementioned advanced analytical techniques have led to multiple improvements in lipidomics, particularly in the extraction methods and bioinformatics. These enhancements have allowed important goals, such as the identification of several lipid-based biomarkers, useful as diagnostic tools [5, 10] . However, the number of lipidomics studies in the field of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remains rather limited, especially when compared to the numerous investigations about their transcriptome and proteome. Thus, the objective of the current review was to focus on recently highlighted roles of specific bioactive lipid species and their involvement in the MSCs-related inflammatory scenario.MSCs are non-hematopoietic multipotent progenitor cells with the ability to differentiate into different mesodermal lineages including osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes [15, 16] . The three criteria adopted by the International Society for Cellular Therapy to define and identify MSCs are: (1) MSCs must be adherent to plastic under standard culture conditions;(2) their phenotypes must present the expression of CD105, CD73, and CD90 and lack the expression of the hematopoietic cell surface markers CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79\\u03b1, or CD19 and HLA-DR; (3) they must be able to differentiate under stimulation in vitro into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondroblasts [17, 18] . MSCs are currently being studied in many preclinical and clinical applications. In particular, they have attracted the scientific interest for their ability to regulate inflammatory processes and promote tissue repair due to their multi-lineage differentiation potential, pro-angiogenic characteristics, and immune-modulatory properties [19] [20] [21] . Recently, MSC-based treatment has been proposed as a suitable therapeutic approach for the severe acute respiratory infection caused by the corona virus SARS-CoV-2. In the COVID-19 scenario, where the immune system produces large amounts of inflammatory factors, the MSC therapy can prevent the storm release of cytokines by the immune system and promote endogenous repair through their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and reparative properties [22, 23] .Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of MSCs, largely mediated by paracrine signaling [24] , is currently under investigation for several degenerative, autoimmune, and inflammatory disorders, as well as the exact mechanisms underlying their effect [21] . Nevertheless, it is very likely that either a direct cell-cell contact and/or the secretion of soluble factors, including bioactive lipids, and/or extracellular vesicles (EVs) are needed [24] [25] [26] .Generally, MSCs can modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses in vitro and in vivo due to their ability to inhibit T-cell proliferation and dendritic cell maturation, recruit regulatory T-cells, and modulate B-cell functions [21, 27, 28] . Expanded for the first time from human bone marrow (BM), MSCs can also be collected and cultured from several sources including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, or umbilical cord blood and expanded ex vivo for clinical use [29, 30] . Compared to BMs, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have an easier and faster growth in culture, age with a lower rate, maintain the mesenchymal pluripotency and stem cell phenotype even after a high number of passages in culture, and show a great proliferative rate with a consequent relatively high yield (about 2500 fold higher than BM) [15, 16, 31, 32] . Moreover, ASCs have shown a great potential of differentiation into several cellular lineages and a good stability throughout long-term cultures; they are characterized by immunomodulatory properties making them immunosuppressive [30] . Moreover, their secretome presents a mix of cytokines, extracellular matrix molecules and proteases, lipid mediators, hormones, and growth factors that are also involved in the angiogenesis process with a great utility and applicability in wound healing and tissue regeneration [15, [33] [34] [35] . In addition to BMSCs and ASCs, skeletal muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) have been used in clinical trials for the regener-ation and repair of injured tissues, because of their high proliferation rate and their ability to secrete trophic factors promoting endogenous tissues repair [36] ; moreover, MDSCs harvesting consists in micro-biopsies obtained as small skin punctures under local anesthesia [37, 38] . Although they exhibit slow-growing adherent behavior after isolation, MDSCs are characterized by a long-term self-renewal, and an easy differentiation into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes in vitro [37] .Endogenous bioactive lipids cover a pivotal role in very important biological phenomena, such as inflammation, immune regulation, and maintenance of homeostasis [39, 40] . Indeed, defects in their metabolism and unbalanced biosynthesis are involved in the pathogenesis and clinical course of chronic inflammation diseases [39, 40] . Based on their biosynthesis, bioactive lipids can be grouped into different families (Table 1) : polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)-derived mediators (generally known as eicosanoids), endocannabinoids (eCBs), and lysophospholipids (LPLs) [41] . Bioactive lipids derived from PUFA can be further divided into two subgroups: one is represented by \\u03c96 arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 \\u03c96)-derived lipid mediators, including prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes (LTs), thromboxanes (TXs), and lipoxins (LXs); the other includes \\u03c93-PUFA-derived lipid mediators, such as the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 \\u03c93) and the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 \\u03c93), i.e., E-series and D-series resolvins (Rvs), protectins (PDs), and maresins (MaRs), collectively termed \\\"specialized pro-resolving mediators\\\" (SPMs). Except for LXs, \\u03c96-PUFA-derived lipids are pro-inflammatory, in contrast with \\u03c93-PUFA-derived lipids, which act as anti-inflammatory. In detail, SPMs stimulate key cellular events, by acting as agonists, stopping further neutrophil influx and the activation of non-phlogistic responses by macrophages and, therefore, leading to the resolution of the inflammation. ECBs and eCB-like compounds originate from \\u03c96and \\u03c93-PUFA metabolism, but also from saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (SFA and MUFA), such as palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0), or oleic acids (18:1 n9). Nowadays, pro-and anti-inflammatory properties exerted by eCBs and eCB-like compounds are issues of intense research [42, 43] . Finally, membrane-derived bioactive lipids derived from LPLs can be divided into lysoglycerophospholipids (LGPLs) and lysosphingophospholipids (LSLs), based on the presence of glycerol or sphingosine (S) as backbone of their structures. LPLs exert pleiotropic effects such as inflammation, vesicular trafficking, endocytosis, apoptosis, cell migration, and cell-stress responses [44] . In this review, we will outline the biological activities and metabolisms of the major bioactive lipids identified as essential regulators in the complex scenario of inflammation and as players in the immunoregulation exerted by MSCs. LGPLs, LSLsThe group of eicosanoids represents the widest family of bioactive lipids and includes several molecules characterized by the long carbon chain \\u03c96 AA or \\u03c93 EPA and DHA as common precursors. \\u03c96 AA, released from membrane phospholipids firstly via phospholipase A2 and secondarily by phospholipase C, is the substrate for three different enzymes leading to the generation of pleiotropic and heterogenous compounds: (1) cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 (COX-1/2) drive the synthesis of PGs (PGD 2 , PGE 2 , PGI 2 , and PGF 2\\u03b1 ), prostacyclins, and TXs [45, 46] , also known as prostanoids; (2) 5-, 12-and 15-lypooxygenases (5/12/15-LOX) synthetize LTs [47, 48] , lipoxins (LXs) [49] and hydroxyeicosatetraenoids (HETEs) [50] ; (3) P450 epoxygenase generates also HETEs, and epoxyeicosatrienoids (ETEs) [50] . \\u03c93 PUFAs-derived bioactive products are Rvs, PDs, and MaRs. Rvs derive from either EPA or DHA and can be further divided into E-series or D-series, respectively. DHA acts also as a precursor for the biosynthesis of PDs and MaRs ( Figure 1 ). The \\u03c96 eicosanoids play an essential active role in the inflammatory response, such as leukocyte chemotaxis and activation, fever, pain [40] , and are usually associated to acute inflammatory processes and chronic inflammation. Indeed, PGs seem to promote inflammation through several mechanisms such as increasing the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines [51] [52] [53] , enhancing the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, promoting innate immunity response [54] , recruiting leukocytes and activating two distinct T helper subsets, TH1 and TH17 [55, 56] . LTs generally recruit neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, and TH17 lymphocytes, and are responsible for the induction of edema. Vasoconstriction and vasodilatation are promoted instead by TXs and prostacyclins, respectively [57] . On the other hand, the \\u03c93 family seems to have a beneficial impact on inflammation, by acting via different mechanisms, for example by working as substrate competitors able to inhibit the conversion of AA into pro-inflammatory eicosanoids or serving as an alternative substrate to produce less potent LTs, PGs, and TGs. In animal models, Rvs and PDs shorten the resolution of inflammation for certain diseases [41, 58, 59] and can also increase animal survival [60, 61] . Two of the major Rvs, RvD1 and RvD2, have shown in vivo anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution properties, by blocking the neutrophil infiltration in many disorders, such as obesity and pathologies affecting the vascular [62] , renal and dermal systems, and also in processes as wound healing, fibrosis, and pain [60] . Moreover, \\u03c93 PUFAderived mediators that have been found within the inflammatory exudate (RvE1 and PD1) show great anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions both in vitro and in vivo [51, 63] . However, the resolution of inflammation is also mediated by other metabolites of AA [64] . Indeed, PGJ (15-deoxy-delta-13,14-PGJ 2 ), the bioconversion product of PGD 2 , increases during the resolution phase and acts as a brake on inflammation by inducing apoptosis of inflammatory cells [65] . The concentration of the lipoxygenase product LXA 4 (lipoxin A 4 ) is also increased during the resolution phase and acts as a stop signal for the acute response [66] . Finally, AA-derived EETs present anti-inflammatory properties through the suppression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) activation and govern vasorelaxation and fibrinolysis [67] .eCBs are endogenous lipid compounds that can bind G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) in the same way as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of Cannabis sativa. The plant Cannabis sativa and its preparations, marijuana and hashish, are being used for many years for recreational and medical purposes [68] because of the pleasurable effects triggered by THC, modulated by the other major, nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid, called cannabidiol (CBD). Both components possess other important medical properties, such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-emetic (THC), and anxiolytic (CBD). [69] . Thanks to the studies performed on cannabis plants and their peculiar chemical components, researchers were able to discover one of the most intriguing and pleiotropic endogenous signaling systems, the endocannabinoid system (eCBS). eCBs, CB receptors, and the biochemical entities that produce and degrade these lipids, are involved in most aspects of the mammalian physiology and pathology [70] . The compound arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA) [71] , the first isolated ethanolamide of AA, represents a partial agonist of CB receptors, while 2-arachidonoylglicerol (2-AG) (another derivative of AA) [72, 73] , is a full agonist ( Figure 1 ). Both compounds AEA and 2-AG belong to the group of PUFA AA-related lipid mediators, and as CB receptor ligands, they stimulate a variety of bioactivities, including analgesia, catalepsy, hypolocomotion, and hypothermia [68] . Moreover, AEA exhibits anti-inflammatory properties [74] , whereas 2-AG shows both proand anti-inflammatory characteristics [75, 76] . Thus, dysfunctions leading to changes in concentration levels, metabolism, and receptors of eCBs could be related to alterations in homeostasis and to the progression of chronic inflammatory status [77] . Moreover, two metabolically active \\u03c93 fatty acid ethanolamides, N-eicosapentaenoylethanolamine (EPEA) and N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine (DHEA) [78, 79] , have been proposed as additional CB receptor agonists [80] . These \\u03c93 eCBs were found to possess anti-inflammatory properties in macrophages [81] and adipocytes [82] . In addition to CB1 and CB2 receptors, pharmacological studies suggest the presence also of different receptors that can mediate the cannabinoids effects. Indeed, besides AEA, other ethanolamides coming from various longchain fatty acids were discovered, and collectively known as N-acylethanolamines (NAEs). Ethanolamides of SFA and MUFA such as palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids, which are more abundant than AEA in mammals, show no activity for CB receptors, but act on other receptors, like the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\\u03b1 (PPAR\\u03b1), leading to the trigger of biological events including anti-inflammation and appetite suppression [83, 84] . In detail, the PPAR\\u03b1-mediated actions of N-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) include anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-epileptic, and neuroprotective properties [85, 86] . Moreover, PEA could also activate the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPCR55 [87] , one of the discussed candidates as CB3 receptor, even though this agonist activity has not been fully elucidated yet. Another saturated NAE, N-stearoylethanolamide (SEA), was reported to act as an anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory agent and cell growth controller, through still unknown targets [88] [89] [90] . Finally, a variety of eCB-related compounds, containing fatty acid chains conjugated with different polar heads, have been discovered as a result of advancements of the analytical techniques [91, 92] . Within the novel group of lipids generally referred as lipoamino acids, N-arachidonoylglycine (NAGly), the most important member, possesses anti-inflammatory effects by targeting the G-protein coupled receptor GPCR18 [93, 94] , vasorelaxant properties [95] and seems to be involved in cell migration [96] , and inhibition of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) [97] , the AEA inactivating enzyme. Moreover, NAgly might have either a physiological role in the resolution of acute inflammatory response and become a potential therapeutic candidate for the resolution of chronic inflammation, by increasing the production of PGJ and LXA 4 , reducing the migration of inflammatory cells into areas of acute inflammation and inducing the death of inflammatory cells [93] . eCBs are endogenous lipid compounds that can bind G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) in the same way as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of Cannabis sativa. The plant Cannabis sativa and its preparations, LPLs are bioactive signaling lipids consisting of O-acyl chain, generated from phospholipase-mediated hydrolyzation of membrane glycerophospholipids (GPLs) and sphingolipids (SLs). Consequently, LPLs are classified into two main categories: glyceryl-based LPLs (including LPA) and sphingosyl-based (including S1P) with a glycerol or a sphingosine backbone, respectively [98, 99] (Figure 1 ). Several LPLs compounds are asymmetrically distributed in the plasma membrane and are characterized by a polar head group (ethanolamine, choline, inositol, serine) and a hydrophobic tail of carbon chain. LPLs act as signaling mediators by binding seven-transmembrane domain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The two major bioactive LPLs are the well-characterized lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and they play important roles in various physio-pathological processes, including inflammation. LPA, a byproduct of lysophosphaditylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidilinositol (LPI), is a signaling mediator involved in cell renewal, immune response, and inflammatory cascade [100, 101] . LPA can be synthetized both intracellularly and extracellularly by different enzymes and via different pathways, such as autotaxin/ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 2 (ENNP2) and/or phospholipases A1 and A2, whereas its degradation is mediated by lipid phosphate phosphatases 1-3 [102] . Currently, six LPA receptors (LPA 1-6) are known [102] . Recently, LPA is reported to be rapidly formed during the resolution phase of the inflammation and, successively, to be recruited via the common pro-resolving formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2, also known as ALX), which is expressed on T cells and their subsets [103] . On the other hand, SLs, such as ceramides and sphingosines, participate in different stages of inflammation as well, by controlling intracellular trafficking and signaling, cell proliferation, adhesion, vascularization, survival, and apoptosis [104, 105] . In particular, the phosphate forms of sphingolipids, ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) and S1P [106] , are notably associated to inflammatory responses. S1P is synthesized by the intracellular phosphorylation of sphingosine via sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (SK1 and SK2) and degraded by S1P lyase or ceramide synthases. It is involved in the resolution phase (together with C1P) since apoptotic cells present at the inflammation sites attract pro-resolving macrophages via S1P receptor 1 [107] and, additionally, it can act either on COX-2 or NF-kB, whereas C1P acts on phospholipase A2 [102] .Lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in stem cells physiopathology [108] [109] [110] . However, at the moment the number of studies about the lipidome of MSCs is limited, and mainly focused on variations in lipid composition during stem cell proliferation and differentiation [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] (Figure 2) .Recently, profiles of glycerophopholipids (GPLs) present in human BMSCs were assessed from young and old donors and across passages during in vitro culture [111] [112] [113] . In particular, since the clinical use of MSCs demands sequential ex vivo expansion, the determination of GPL profiles through the different steps of the in vitro culture represents a crucial and relevant advancement. In general, long-term culturing could contribute to the decrease of the proliferation and the differentiation potential, shorten the telomers, and accumulate \\u03c96 PUFAs with signaling roles, consequently promoting inflammation [114, 115] . It is well established that membrane GPLs provide precursors for signaling lipids that modulate cellular functions, and small changes in their compositions can lead to significant biological consequences. Kilpinen et al. studied the effect of the donor's age and cell doublings on the profile of GPLs of human BMSCs, demonstrating that an extensive expansion modulates membrane GPLs, by increasing total phosphatidylinositol (PI) and lysophospatidylcholine (LPC). Specifically, the effect was more pronounced when BMSCs were isolated from young donors. Moreover, changes in membrane FAs profile during expansion and senescence of BMSCs was highlighted: the \\u03c96 AA content increased, while \\u03c93 PUFAs (especially DHA) decreased during long-term cultivation, leading to an impair-ment of the immunological functionality [111] . In addition, in the later steps of the process, an increment of the fraction of individual SFA was noticed [111] . A significant modification of membrane FAs composition of MSCs derived from human fetal membranes (FM-MSCs), occurring during in vitro culture, was assessed by Chatgilialoglu et al. [112] . In detail, fresh uncultured FM-MSCs showed variability in their membrane FAs composition, likely due to the genetic diversity and different lifestyle of the donors. This study also reveals that cultured cells have lower proportions of PUFAs than freshly isolated cells showing a great drop in \\u03c96 FAs, counterbalanced by a marked increase in MUFA and \\u03c93 FAs. These data are in contrast with Kilpinen et al. [111] . More recently, a lipidomics profiling analysis during BMSCs culturing passages by Lu et al. investigates the metabolic alteration of various lipid species in the senescence process [113] . They applied an untargeted lipidomics approach based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), which allowed the reduction of the complexity of the matrix and the enhancement of the sensitivity, factors that represent an improvement relative to the previously described shotgun-based methods. The majority of GPLs, as well as SLs, were found to significantly increase across the culturing passages, whereas the PA, PIs, and phosphatidylserines (PSs) levels were lower in aged cells. These findings were largely coherent with previous described studies, except for PI species, which were found to be increased during all the passages [111] . Nevertheless, the reduced amount of PIs is inconsistent with the relative transcriptomics analysis, which showed an increase in the enzymes expression with consequential conversion of PA into PIs suggesting an enhanced PIs biosynthesis activity. Moreover, research on the functional FAs has largely supported regulatory roles for PGs in MSCs proliferation. In particular, PGE 2 increases human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (UCMSCs) proliferation through \\u03b2-catenin-mediated c-Myc and vascular endothelial growth factor expression via exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac1)/Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1)/Akt and PKA cooperation [116] , and through interaction of profilin-1 (Pfn-1) and filamentousactin (F-actin) via EP2 receptor-dependent \\u03b2-arrestin-1/JNK signaling pathways [117] . On the contrary, the investigation of PGE 2 and prostaglandin D2 (PGD 2 ) effects on MSCs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation suggests that both their receptors are highly expressed in these cells and both prostaglandins seem to have a negative impact [118] . In detail, PGE 2 firstly enhances the MSCs growth-rate, while longer stimulation leads to a growth-inhibitory effect. Contrarily, PGD 2 inhibits MSCs growth regardless of the duration of the exposure. Moreover, their inhibitory effect on calcium deposition also suggests a negative impact on MSCs osteogenic differentiation [118] . Moreover, TXs class has been investigated for its effect on MSCs proliferation, suggesting the role of TXA 2 as potent modulator of ASCs migration and proliferation through ERK and p38 MAPK signaling mechanisms [119] . In addition, TXA 2 appears to induce ASCs differentiation into smooth-muscle-like cells [119, 120] . Concerning eCBS, Rossi et al. [121] described a gradual decrease during subculture in AEA and 2-AG levels secreted by human BMSCs starting from passage 1 (AEA: 5 pmol/mg protein and 2-AG: 11 pmol/mg protein 2-AG) and this finding was also confirmed by Kose et al. [122] . ASCs secrete AEA and 2-AG at 3.5 and 7.3 pmol/mg protein, respectively, at early passages [123] . In addition, 2-AG and CB1/CB2 stimulation recruits BMSCs, most probably via an indirect activation of CB2 receptors [124] .During MSCs differentiation, eCBS variation was also highlighted and the expression of CB1 and CB2 is considerably lower in undifferentiated cells and it increases during osteogenic [125, 126] and adipogenic commitment [125] . Furthermore, the activation of CB2 signaling plays an important role in promoting the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro, with an increase of alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), an induction of the expression of specific osteogenic genes including Runx2, Osterix, IBSP, SPP1, OCN, COL1a1, and an enhanced deposition of calcium in the extracellular matrix [126] . This result indicates a key role of CB2 receptor in BMSCs differentiation towards osteoblasts, suggesting also that MSCs might produce endogenous cannabinoids able to reinforce their osteogenic differentiation as well. Moreover, the knockdown of CB2 receptor in BMSCs by small interference RNA (siRNA) inhibits ALP activity and mineralization [126] . Most recently the osteogenic differentiation induced by CB2 signaling activation has been shown to involve autophagy induction and sequestosome 1/p62-mediated Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2Related Factor 2 deactivation [127] . Whereas, the implication of eCBs in BMSCs physiology related to their adipocyte differentiation was validated looking at the increased expression of CB1, transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) and PPAR\\u03b3 during adipogenesis [128] . Moreover, the effects of AEA, N-arachidonoydopamine (NADA), and 2-AG were evaluated suggesting a promotion of adipocyte differentiation by AEA and an inhibition by NADA. No changes were observed with 2-AG at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Furthermore, CB1 may stimulate protein expression, such as adiponectin during adipogenesis [125, 129] , since it is enriched in mature adipocytes compared to other cell types [129] . Moreover, based on the effect of AEA, CB1 expression seems to be correlated to the increment of FAAH and COX-2 during adipogenic differentiation [130] . Lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in stem cells physiopathology [108] [109] [110] . However, at the moment the number of studies about the lipidome of MSCs is limited, and mainly focused on variations in lipid composition during stem cell proliferation and differentiation [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] (Figure 2 ). Recently, profiles of glycerophopholipids (GPLs) present in human BMSCs were assessed from young and old donors and across passages during in vitro culture [111] [112] [113] . In particular, since the clinical use of MSCs demands sequential ex vivo expansion, the determination of GPL profiles through the different steps of the in vitro culture represents a crucial and relevant advancement. In general, long-term culturing could contribute to the decrease of the proliferation and the differentiation potential, shorten the telomers, and accumulate \\u03c96 PUFAs with signaling roles, consequently promoting inflammation [114, 115] . It is well established that membrane GPLs provide precursors for signaling lipids that modulate cellular functions, and small changes in their compositions can lead to significant biological consequences. Kilpinen et al. studied the effect of the donor's age and cell doublings on the profile of GPLs of human BMSCs, demonstrating that an exten- In addition, Pagano et al. found out that ASCs exposed to the synthetic cannabinoid WIN55,212-2 increase the glucose uptake, the calcium influx, and the expression of the adipogenesis regulator PPAR-\\u03b3; contrarily, these effects are inhibited by the specific CB1antagonist Rimonabant [131] . Finally, Silva et al. has analyzed the lipidome of rabbit ASCs and MDSCs and their adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation identifying 1687 lipid species [132] . These animal MSCs have shown different lipid profiles as well as changes in lipid composition after adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, the N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) expression levels suggest lipid similarities in cells differentiated from different stem cell sources [132] . In conclusion, PUFAs and their bioactive derivatives affect both the proliferation and differentiation of several MSCs and consequently modulate their immunological interaction with other cells. In this perspective, lipid profiling can represent a valuable tool also in the screening of MSC populations prior to their use in both experimental and clinical settings. Indeed, the possibility of evaluating selected lipid classes or MSC entire lipidome can rapidly provide a screenshot of their differentiative status and growth rate, thus, allowing to harness MSC potential at its best for the diverse applications.MSCs present anti-inflammatory properties and are being used with great success as treatment for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. They have been shown to migrate towards injured tissues affected by inflammatory events, led by several growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines [133] . Being physiologically recruited at the damaged site, MSCs are often submitted to a strong, pro-inflammatory environment. It is well known that the PGE 2 secretion is increased upon incubation with the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\\u03b1) and the interferon gamma (IFN-\\u03b3) [28] . To better understand the involvement of the lipidome in the MSCs anti-inflammatory properties and underlying its mechanisms of action, Campos et al. [134] have performed a wide range lipidomic analysis of MSCs under pro-inflammatory conditions induced by the presence of 10 ng/mL TNF-\\u03b1 and 500 U/mL IFN-\\u03b3. This study has evidenced a change in MSCs PL profile under the pro-inflammatory stimulus: indeed, higher levels of molecular PC species with longer FA acyl chains and lower levels of molecular PC species with shorter FA acyl chains were assessed. Moreover, the expressions of the specific PE(40:6), PS(36:1), LPC(18:0), and SM(34:0) were enhanced, while PE(O-38:6) and PS(40:4) expressions decreased simultaneously. The increase of LPC (18:0) has already been correlated with anti-inflammatory properties by others [135, 136] . These differences were identified only in specific GPL subspecies, suggesting that each GPL subspecies could play a role in MSCs immunological functions. Moreover, the characteristics of the lipidome of the untreated MSCs described by Campos et al. were consistent with previous results [111] , with the exception of the presence of sphingomyelins [134] , which have not been previously identified. As formerly described, some derivatives of SLs, such as S1P, are bioactive and mediate essential cell functions [137] .Concerning the MSCs lipid secretion, PGE 2 was widely investigated given its key role in the immunosuppressive activity of MSCs [28] . Masoodi and colleagues [138] have analyzed the release of PGs by human heart-derived MSCs by HPLC-MS/MS, finding the presence of PGE 1 , PGE 2 , PGE 3 , 6-keto PGF 1\\u03b1 , PGF 2\\u03b1 , and PGJ 2 in the conditioned medium. Although PGE 2 has been linked to the immunosuppressive effects of MSCs since their inhibitors production attenuate MSC-mediated immunomodulation [28] , PGs are best known for their ability to mediate vasodilatation that allows immune cells to invade inflamed tissue. Indeed, recent evidence suggests also that PGE 2 may have an immunostimulatory role by facilitating Th1 differentiation and expanding the Th17 Tcells population [55] . Since prostaglandins have a short half-life, they act as paracrine and autocrine factors in the local environment. MSCs themselves also express receptors for prostaglandins: EP1, EP2, EP4, FP, and IP. The effects triggered by the stimulation of these receptors on MSCs are still unknown. However, the profile of PGs highlighted in MSCs is superimposable with that of their receptors (prostaglandins type E and F, and prostacyclin). Thus, the dual and controversial immunomodulatory properties of MSCs can depend on the local environment, where IFN-\\u03b3 and TNF-\\u03b1 play a pivotal role in promoting immunosuppressive function of MSCs [139, 140] .In the presence of PGE 2 , also a higher expression of EP3, which is involved in the stimulation of angiogenesis, was obtained in MSCs suggesting a possible correlation with the early phases of inflammation [118] .Recent studies have evidenced the roles of LXs as regulators of the resolution phase of inflammation [61] and of Rvs as players in the immunoregulation of MSCs [141] . Fang et al. have demonstrated the MSCs ability of promoting the resolution of acute lung injuries in mice through the secretion of lipoxin A 4 (LXA 4 ), the first identified anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediator [142] , signaling via the G protein coupled ALX/FPR2 receptors [141] .The \\u03c93 fatty acids EPA and DHA, which are found mainly in marine oils, have long been thought to have anti-inflammatory properties, whereby they compete with AA, by reducing pro-inflammatory eicosanoids [143] . The molecular mechanism through which this occurs is still unclear, and there are no evidences about beneficial effects of \\u03c93 EPA and DHA for human health as well as their role as potential treatments for human diseases. In most mammalian cell types, different exogenous supplements of PUFAs are incorporated into plasma membrane GPL and then metabolized by phospholipases in order to produce various lipid mediators. Thus, the biochemical homeostasis of lipid profile in mammalian membranes must be perturbed not only by physio-pathological inputs, but also by external lipid uptake (i.e., dietary fats). A recent study performed on human BMSCs has demonstrated the increase of the secretion of the pro-inflammatory PGE 2 after AA supplements intake. However, this possible harmful effect can be attenuated by the chain elongation on the less active precursor, \\u03c96 22:4. The \\u03c93 PUFAs precursor, the alfa-linolenic acid (18:3), shows a slight reduction of its GPL AA content, while the EPA (20:5) and DHA (22:6) acid supplements efficiently displace the AA, creating several pools of GPL species substrates that allow attenuation of inflammatory signaling [144] .Osteoarthritis (OA) is a heterogeneous chronic joint disease characterized by the processes of degradation, repair, and inflammation that occur in the connective tissue, the vulnerable layer of joints, synovium, and subchondral bone [145] . From a molecular point of view, the catabolic and anabolic activities are unbalanced, and the major injury response occurs at the joint cartilage level. Recently, findings regarding the involvement of lipids in OA development and progression indicate a possible involvement of \\u03c93 PUFAs and their anti-inflammatory SPMs derivatives [146] . The most studied bioactive lipids, PGs and LTs, have been detected in plasma and synovial fluid of OA patients showing pro-inflammatory and catabolic effects on fibroblasts, osteoblasts and cartilage [147] . Moreover, the PGE 2 and AA-derived oxylipin 15-HETE levels were related to knee OA [148] , suggesting a possible role in the disease progression. Because of the similarities between OA course and chronic wound accompanied by cell death, inflammation, and pain [149] and since \\u03c93 PUFAs/SPMs have been shown to target all these processes, it is conceivable that these lipids could be effective therapeutic agents for OA. In the context of this disease, few studies have investigated the FAs presence in OA affecting patients and their relationship to clinical symptoms. These studies indicated that increases of \\u03c93 FAs levels could be associated with a reduced cartilage loss while the increase of the increase of \\u03c96 FAs levels with enhanced synovitis [150] . All studies performed with \\u03c93 PUFAs suggest that the beneficial effects consist primarily in an improvement in symptoms and pain, whereas little effects are observed on structural progression of the OA disease. However, previous studies have reported that \\u03c93 PUFAs can counteract the pro-inflammatory and catabolic actions of interleukin-1a (IL-1a) on cartilage in vitro [151] . These results were consistent with a more recent study in which the authors have shown the involvement of DHA in the downregulation of MMP-13 through a P38 mitogen activated protein kinases (p38-MAPK)-mediated mechanism [152] both in vitro and in vivo in a rat model of OA. Apart from direct effects of \\u03c93 PUFAs on OA, it is conceivable that \\u03c93-derived oxylipins could be generated in vitro (i.e., by chondrocytes) and these could mediate the observed effects. Another study confirmed the presence of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, such as PGE 2 , in OA synovial fluid, as well as oxylipins derived from \\u03c93 and \\u03c96 PUFA such as 15-HETE (derived from AA), 17-HDHA (derived from DHA), and 18-HEPE (derived from EPA). When the pro-inflammatory response occurs in the cartilage, some types of prostanoid enzymes, such as COX, will be produced and released in excessive amounts. COX activation will increase the production of MMP, inhibit the expression of PGE 2 and collagen genes and will stimulate the apoptosis process. Studies conducted by Hardy et al. [153] and Shimpo et al. [154] have analyzed the role of PGE 2 in chondro-cytes. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1\\u03b2 stimulates the production of PGE 2 in large quantities, and this could induce the degradation process of OA. At the molecular level, IL-1\\u03b2 will increase the expression of the COX-2 gene and the microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 at mRNA and protein levels. Therefore, an increase in PGE 2 production is related to mPGES-1 and COX-2 derivatives from osteoarthritis chondrocytes stimulated by IL-1\\u03b2. Another recent study has shown the beneficial effects of resolvin D1 on OA chondrocytes. RvD1 belongs to the family of D-series Rvs, which includes RvD2-RvD6 and share the common precursor 17-HDHA. In one study, RvD1 was found to inhibit the IL-1\\u03b2-mediated upregulation of COX-2, PGE 2 , MMP13, and nitric oxide and to prevent chemically induced apoptosis in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes [155] . These effects are mediated by the downregulation of the nuclear factor NF-kB, p38-MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases activation, as well as inactivation of caspase9 and upregulation of Bcl-2 and Akt. Despite the high concentrations of RvD1 used in this study (mM range), these data indicate for the first time the potency of an SPM to counteract deleterious processes in OA chondrocytes. MSCs have been demonstrated to be effective in the treatments of different tissue injuries and, in particular, they have been considered as a promising alternative cell source for cartilage repair [156] . However, recent studies have suggested that the beneficial effects of MSCs on injured tissues could be attributed to the activation of a protective mechanism and the stimulation of endogenous regeneration rather than to their differentiation potential [157] . MSC-secreted bioactive molecules and/or EVs may act as paracrine or endocrine mediators that directly activate target cells or neighboring cells to secrete functionally active agents. Indeed, we recently demonstrated the therapeutic potential of ASCs secretome and EVs both in vitro on TNF\\u03b1-stimulated articular chondrocytes [158, 159] , and in vivo in a mouse model of OA [160] , providing evidences of MSC mediated anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory action. Consistently, the influence of MSCs towards PGE 2 gene expression was studied in the pathogenesis of OA. One study showed that MSCs could significantly (p < 0.05) reduce PGE 2 expression in OA synoviocytes after 24 and 48 h co-culture compared to control cells [161] . Moreover, several researches disclosed that MSC-derived EVs stimulate tissue regeneration [162] , and EVs have generally important functions in cell communication and regulation. EVs are home to the inflammatory site and transfer proteins/peptides, mRNA, microRNA, lipids, or organelles with reparative and anti-inflammatory properties [161, 163] . Lipids are essential components of the EVs membranes, and it is well known that specific lipids are enriched in EVs compared to their parent cells. For example, it has been shown a 2-3 times enrichment from cells to EVs for cholesterol, GPLs, and PSs [164, 165] . On the contrarily, EVs generally contained less PCs than their parent cells. At the moment, the physiological importance of the asymmetric lipids distribution between EVs and parent cells is still largely unknown. Compared to the original BMSCs, Xiang et al. found out that MSC-EVs were highly enriched in the cell proliferation and migration mediator S1P by the involvement of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) [166] . In detail, human chondrocytes were co-cultured with MSC-EVs showing enhanced proliferation and decreased apoptosis induced by IL-1\\u03b2, known as one of the main inflammatory mediators for arthritis. The highlighted MSC-EVs therapeutic effect occurs in part through the S1P/S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) signaling pathway activation. So, also this study suggests the implication of lipids and their related pathways (i.e., S1P/S1PR1) into the clinical application of MSC-EVs to the treatment of articular cartilage defect. Future lipidomic research, aimed at characterizing the lipid mediators of the crosstalk among MSCs and other articular cell types (e.g., chondrocytes, synoviocytes, or osteoblasts), would likely uncover additional inflammatory pathways associated with OA, with interesting repercussions in the clinical management of this pathology.In the last few years, lipidomics has gathered the interest of the scientific community because of the recently confirmed role of lipids in several biochemical aspects as first actors. In detail, lipids are recognized as key players in cells membrane and signaling processes, such as inflammation and immunomodulation. Furthermore, cell lipidome changes according to different cell phases and microenvironment features. Therefore, by analyzing differences in profiles of specific lipid species, it is possible to obtain insights regarding lipids interference in cell signaling and other cellular mechanisms. Lipidomics has proved being successful in identifying viable and functional cell cultures, which could guarantee efficient and safe MSCs application. Despite the limited availability of data regarding MSC lipidomics, the pleiotropic biological actions of different lipid families indicate them as promising candidates for future therapeutic interventions. No new data were created or analyzed in this study.

SARS-CoV-2 continuously circulated, even among individuals with preexisting immunity, and since COVID-19 began until the time of writing has caused about 271 million confirmed cases along with 5.2 million deaths worldwide [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) might escape the humoral immune response to natural infection or vaccination [4, 5] , which reinforces the necessity of specific antiviral treatments. After almost a two-year effort in the repurposing of clinically approved drugs, limited benefits for COVID -19 patients have been demonstrated [5] . Thus, it is necessary to improve the pre-clinical characterization of repurposed drugs to rationalize further clinical studies, in terms of posology and susceptibility of VoC, and learn from their interactions with the viral target enzyme.During the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, viral surface glycoprotein spike interacts with human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and with the extracellular protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to enter the cells. Positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA is translated to polyproteins that are auto-cleaved by viral papain-like (PL pro ) and major (M pro ) proteases. These matured non-structural proteins (nsp), such as nsp12/8/7 (RNA polymerase complex), nsp13 (helicase), nsp14/10 (exonuclease and N7-ethyltransferase), nsp15 (endonuclease) and nsp16 (2'-O-methyltransferase), are responsible for RNA replication and transcription of structural genes. These structural genes will be translated, assembled with the newly synthetized genomic RNA and bud as a new virus progeny. These events represent key steps during viral life cycle to potentially limit SARS-CoV-2 replication [6] .We have previously described that atazanavir (ATV, Figure 1 ), a clinically approved human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor [7] , is endowed with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity [8] .

The 2D-and 3D-chemical structure for atazanavir (ATV).Studies reconfirmed, by bioinformatics and basic enzymatic inhibition curves, that ATV targets SARS-CoV-2 major protease (M pro ), an enzyme responsible for the cleavage of 11 sites of the viral polyprotein, a key-step in virus life cycle [13, 14] . The development by Pfizer of PAXLOVID TM (PF-07321332), combined with ritonavir, (Figure S1 , Supplementary Material) showed clinical efficacy in reduce hospitalization by 80%, reconfirming that M pro is a very important druggable target [15] . Thus, other drugs that target this enzyme deserve a more detailed characterization, to provide insight on pharmacophoric regions for next generation of anti-COVID-19 antivirals.Anti-M pro from ATV has been disputed as controversial depending on assay conditions [16] . This apparent paradox reinforces that detailed mechanism of action and robust series of pre-clinical experiments should be conducted to shed light on the ATV inhibitory mechanism and the susceptibility of contemporaneous SARS-CoV-2 strains to this drug. Here, we address additional explanations to controversial effects of ATV on M pro , characterizing it as a competitive inhibitor of this viral enzyme that requires a catalytic water to be effective. ATV possesses anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity against B.1 and gamma strains on Calu-3 cells, a model of type II pneumocytes. ATV reached the plasma and lungs of treated Swiss-Webster mice and protected SARS-CoV-2-infected transgenic mice expression in human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (K18-hACE2) from mortality. Moreover, ATV reduced virus-induced inflammation and cell death in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and lung damage in infected and treated animals. This study compiles pre-clinical results that may allow further rationalization of clinical trials against COVID-19.To advance on details on how ATV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 M pro , we initially performed a dose-dependent inhibition curve. ATV was slightly less potent than the positive control GC376 [17] (Figure 2A ). The Morrison's inhibitory constant (K i ) values for GC376 and ATV were 208 \\u00b1 0.15 and 703 \\u00b1 79 nM, respectively. Next, we tested ATV against various concentrations of M pro substrate. We observed that maximum velocity (V max ) values in the presence and absence of ATV were not different, while the Michaelis-Menten constant (K m ) values increased significantly in the presence of this drug ( Figure 2B ), indicating a competitive inhibition profile. Our results are specific to M pro because, differently from the positive control GRL0617, ATV did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PL pro ) ( Figure 2C ). Since structural improvements on the M pro active site were determined more recently [18, 19] , SARS-CoV-2 molecular docking calculations were carried out to test if a catalytic water (H 2 O cat ) was required for ATV action. Since the highest docking score value was obtained in the presence of H 2 O cat , molecular docking calculations suggested a dependence of ATV potency of water content into the catalytic site of M pro - Figure 2D for M pro and ATV in the presence of H 2 O cat and Figure S2 in the Supplementary Material for the 2D-plot image corresponding to the main amino acid residues which interact with ATV in the absence and presence of H 2 O cat . The GOLD 2020.2 software ranked the ten best docking poses and at analyzing each pose, none of them showed a conformation for the interaction between the pyridyl group of ATV and the catalytic water.The competitive inhibition implies that M pro 's substrate concentration may affect its susceptibility to ATV. Thus, we tested if ATV's potency is also affected in type II pneumocyte cell line (Calu-3) infected with different SARS-CoV-2 MOIs. In cell-based assays, the intracellular concentration of M pro 's substrate would be proportional to the virus input. Indeed, ATV's EC 50 value for the SARS-CoV-2 B.1 lineage varied in a MOIdependent way (Table 1) , similarly to remdesivir (RDV) ( Table 1) , a competitive inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase complex under clinical use [20, 21] . The SARS-CoV-2 gamma VoC is similarly susceptible to ATV, compared to its predecessor strain B.1 (Table 1) . Since the CC 50 values of 312 \\u00b1 8 and 512 \\u00b1 30 \\u00b5M for ATV and RDV, respectively, their selective index (SI) values were consistent with an adequate safety profile in vitro (Table 1) . We first aimed evaluate ATV's pharmacokinetics profile over time in the plasma and lungs of Swiss-Webster mice treated with 60 mg/kg of this drug, a dosage equivalent to its plasma exposure in humans under treatment against HIV. Upon treatment with 60 mg/kg, ATV concentration in the plasma was similar to the standard treatment of 300 mg in humans ( Figure 3A ) [22] . Interestingly, ATV seems to be concentrated in the lung of the treated animals ( Figure 3B ).Next, we infected K18-hACE2-transgenic mice with SARS-CoV-2 gamma VoC and treated them with a daily oral dose of 60 mg/kg ATV, initiating 12 h after infection. Whereas the infection kills all animals within 6 days, a statistically significant increase in animal survival was observed in the infected and ATV-treated mice ( Figure 4A ). ATV We first aimed evaluate ATV's pharmacokinetics profile over time in the plasma and lungs of Swiss-Webster mice treated with 60 mg/kg of this drug, a dosage equivalent to its plasma exposure in humans under treatment against HIV. Upon treatment with 60 mg/kg, ATV concentration in the plasma was similar to the standard treatment of 300 mg in humans ( Figure 3A ) [22] . Interestingly, ATV seems to be concentrated in the lung of the treated animals ( Figure 3B ).Next, we infected K18-hACE2-transgenic mice with SARS-CoV-2 gamma VoC and treated them with a daily oral dose of 60 mg/kg ATV, initiating 12 h after infection. Whereas the infection kills all animals within 6 days, a statistically significant increase in animal survival was observed in the infected and ATV-treated mice ( Figure 4A ). ATV protected the mice to continue to lose weight at the 6th day after infection ( Figure 4B ). In the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the treated animals, ATV significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels ( Figure 4C ), cell death-based on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity ( Figure 4D ATV reduced the SARS-CoV-2-induced IL-6 levels in the BAL and in the lungs of treated animals ( Figure 5 ). In the lung, levels of TNF-\\u03b1 and KC were also reduced in the infected/untreated over untreated mice ( Figure 5 ). These results are in line with our previous description that ATV decreases the levels of SARS-CoV-2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes [8] and virus-triggered pyroptosis [23] . Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection provoked severe lung injury, leading to hemorrhage, and shrinking of the lobe, bronchiole and alveoli (Figure 6 ), which was reduced by ATV. This protection is the consequence of the direct antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of ATV, since this molecule could not prevent hemorrhage as an anti-clotting agent ( Figure S3, Supplementary Material) . and mononuclear cells counts (E) and immunocytochemical staining (F) were assessed in the BAL six days after infection in the indicated experimental groups. All the analysis were performed with 6 mice/group.ATV reduced the SARS-CoV-2-induced IL-6 levels in the BAL and in the lungs of treated animals ( Figure 5 ). In the lung, levels of TNF-\\u03b1 and KC were also reduced in the infected/untreated over untreated mice ( Figure 5 ). These results are in line with our previous description that ATV decreases the levels of SARS-CoV-2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes [8] and virus-triggered pyroptosis [23] .

However, limited clinical benefit has been documented for most repurposed drugs, whereas in the meantime orally available antiviral drugs against COVID-19 demonstrated clinical efficacy to reduce hospitalization, such as molnupiravir [26] and PAXLOVID TM [15] . Molnupiravir and PAXLOVID TM target the viral Repurposing of clinically approved drugs was considered an accelerated strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections [24, 25] . However, limited clinical benefit has been documented for most repurposed drugs, whereas in the meantime orally available antiviral drugs against COVID-19 demonstrated clinical efficacy to reduce hospitalization, such as molnupiravir [26] and PAXLOVID TM [15] . Molnupiravir and PAXLOVID TM target the viral RNA synthesis and M pro , respectively. Besides detailed mechanism of action, these compounds fulfilled pre-clinical steps of investigation, from cell-based to animal models, to allow further clinical development to be conducted at target plasmatic concentration. Here, we performed pre-clinical study steps for ATV by enzymatic, in silico calculations and cell-based assays, combined with animal models ( Figure S4 in the Supplementary Material). The comprehension that ATV inhibits competitively M pro and requires a catalytic water to enhance ATV's interactions ATV onto the catalytic pocket and, more specifically, with residue His-41, which is one of the constituents of the catalytic dyad, may allow further development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 analogs.We originally demonstrated that ATV inhibited SARS-CoV-2 M pro preparations and virus replication [8] . The controversial effects of ATV on SARS-CoV-2 M pro are documented in the literature [13, 15] . In line with studies that demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to ATV, we demonstrated here that M pro was inhibited by this drug, with K i 1.5-fold higher than GC376 and in a competitive fashion, increasing the enzyme's K m more than sixfold. It is unlikely that the other SARS-CoV-2 protease, PL pro , was targeted by ATV in these assays, because its K i for PL pro was above the threshold of in vitro inhibition.The amino acid residue His-41 of M pro requires water to catalyze proteolytic cleavage [18, 19] and ATV targets this moiety. The presence of 20% glycerol in enzyme assay mixture reduces the water content and prevents ATV activity, that is why Ma and Wang [16, 27] could not identify this HIV protease inhibitor as a potential antiviral against COVID-19, whereas Li et al. [13] reached results similarly to ours. Our enzymatic assay includes bovine serum albumin (BSA) to avoid non-specific binding of small molecules to M pro . In our M pro FRET-based enzymatic assay, reactions were allowed to occur overnight to increase the sensitivity, instead of 1 h [16] . Although one might argue that a longer reaction time will increase the rate of false positive results, the following cell-based assays provide an additional layer of evidence that ATV activity against SARS-CoV-2 is credible.Conversely, whereas ATV depends on water and multiple transient interactions, PF-07321332, which demonstrated clinical benefit [15] , was a covalent inhibitor of M pro [28] . Indeed, PF-07321332 directly target a key amino acid residue, the catalytic cysteine 145 [28] . Additionally, differently than in silico results obtained for ATV, the PF-07321332 is more buried into the protease pocket, probably due to the ligand steric area (781.51 and 493.69 \\u00c5 2 for ATV and PF-07321332, respectively) which result in a hydrogen bonding interaction between PF-07321332 and His-163 that is considered as a crucial residue for natural peptidic substrates [28, 29] .Considering the substrate-dependent inhibitory effect of ATV, we hypothesized ATV's potency in cell-based assays would be influenced by varying the virus input, because higher numbers of virus particles should translate into increased quantities of M pro substrate. To test this hypothesis, Calu-3 cells, which is more closely resemble type II pneumocytes than A549 and Vero cells [9, 10] , were infected with a 100-fold different multiplicity of infections (MOI) of SARS-CoV-2, B.1 lineage, and treated with ATV or RDV, a competitive inhibitor of viral RNA synthesis. The MOI-dependent inhibition was consistent for ATV and RDV. The similarity in the cell-based potency of ATV to its K i for M pro further reinforces the conclusion that M pro is the target of ATV in vitro.The emerging Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 gamma variant, initially detected in the state of Amazonas, was responsible for a public health calamity, spreading rapidly in Brazil and considered as one of variant of concern by WHO. The mutations found in gamma variant have been associated with increased transmissibility, higher viral load, propensity for immune evasion and SARS-CoV-2 reinfection [30, 31] . ATV presented adequate inhibitory At plasma exposures similar to humans [22] , ATV enhanced by 30% the survival of K18-hACE2-transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 gamma strain and decreased virusinduced cell death and inflammation. Despite there is not a statical difference in the body weight between the untreated and treated groups, the protective effect of ATV was viewed in relation to the significantly decrease of SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), as well as a significant reduction in the number of mononuclear leukocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and LDH levels. In the BAL infected and treated animals displayed lower levels of IL-6, TNF-a, KC and PF4, compared to untreated mice. The in vivo anti-inflammatory of ATV observed here is in line with the ability of this molecule to inhibit pyroptosis in human primary monocytes for both BAL and lung samples clearly showing that ATV protect both cell death and inflammation [23, 32] .Our study shows that ATV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 M pro with a mechanism of action different than PAXLOVID TM , showing ATV/M pro interface could give insights for further drug development. The in vitro and in vivo results reconfirm, in different magnitudes, SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to ATV. Further ongoing clinical trials will determine if standard dose, used in HIV-treatment can prevent severe COVID-19 or if it is necessary higher doses [33] . According to ATV's monography [22] , doses three times higher could be used for shorter periods of time, when compared to the life-lasting HIV treatment.Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), tris(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)methylium chloride (crystal violet), formaldehyde, hematoxylin, eosin, phosphate buffer solution (PBS), ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ketamine, xylazine, trisodium citrate, calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ) and remdesivir (RDV) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich/Merck (St. Louis, MO, USA).

The cells were incubated at 310 K in 5% of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ).The SARS-CoV-2 B.1 lineage (GenBank #MT710714) and gamma variant (also known as P1 or B.1.1.28 lineage; #EPI_ISL_1060902) were isolated on Vero E6 cells from nasopharyngeal swabs of confirmed cases. All procedures related to virus culture were handled at biosafety level 3 (BSL3) multiuser facility at Funda\\u00e7\\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, according to world health organization (WHO) guidelines [34] .The ATV capacity to inhibit enzymatic velocity of PL pro and M pro from SARS-CoV-2 was determined by the commercial kit provided by BPS Bioscience \\u00ae company (catalog number: #79995-1 and #79955-1, respectively) following the procedure and recommendations from literature and manufacturer [35] [36] [37] . Basically, 100 nM PL pro was incubated in 50 mM HEPES pH 7. KTSAVLQSGFRKME-EDANS with CAS number 730985-86-1) and ATV or GC376 (positive control), at concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 \\u00b5M. Fluorescence signal was measured at an emission wavelength of 460 nm with excitation at 360 nm in a GloMax \\u00ae (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) plate reader. Morrison's inhibitory constant (K i ) was calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism 9. The Michaelis-Menten plot was conducted for 88.8 nM M pro incubated overnight in assay buffer with substrate concentrations varying from 0 to 100 \\u00b5M in the presence and absence of 2.5 \\u00b5M of ATV. After fluorescence quantification, the Michaelis-Menten constant (K m ) and maximum velocity (V max ) were calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism 9. The value was presented as mean \\u00b1 standard deviation (SD).The crystallographic structure of M pro was obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB), with access code 7K40 [38] . The chemical structure for ATV was built and minimized in terms of energy by Density Functional Theory (DFT) via Spartan'18 software (Wavefunction, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) [39] . The molecular docking calculations were performed with GOLD 2020.2 software (Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center Software Ltd., CCDC, Cambridge CB2 1EZ, UK) [40] . Hydrogen atoms were added to the protease following tautomeric states and ionization data, which are inferred by the GOLD 2020.2 software at pH 7.4. The number of genetic operations (crossing, migration, mutation) during the search procedure was set as 100,000. Redocking studies were carried out with the crystallographic ligand boceprevir (PDB code: 7K40), obtaining the lowest root mean square deviation (RMSD) value by ChemPLP function. It was defined 8 \\u00c5 radius around the active binding site and the figures were generated with PyMOL Delano Scientific LLC software (DeLano Scientific LLC: San Carlos, CA, USA) [41] , while the 2D-plot was obtained by ProteinsPlus platform (Zentrum f\\u00fcr Bioinformatik, Universit\\u00e4t Hamburg, Germany) [42] . After 48 h, the supernatants were harvested, and infectious virus titers were quantified by plaque forming assays according to previous publications [8, 43, 44] .To perform the virus titration, Vero cells (2.0 \\u00d7 10 4 cell/well) in 96-well plates (Nalge Nunc Int, Rochester, NY, USA) were infected with log-based dilutions of the yield reduction assays' supernatants for 1 h at 37 \\u2022 C in 5% of CO 2 . After the incubation, medium containing 1.8% CMC with 5% FBS was added and incubated at 37 \\u2022 C with 5% CO 2 for 72 h. The cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde in PBS and stained with a 0.04% solution of crystal violet in 70% methanol. The virus titers were calculated by scoring the plaque-forming unit-(PFU/mL) and a non-linear regression analysis of the dose-response curves was also performed to calculate the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ). All experiments were carried out at least three independent times, including a minimum of two technical replicates in each assay, and each data was analyzed from Prism GraphPad software 8.0 (Windows GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The value was presented as mean \\u00b1 standard deviation (SD).Vero cells (2.0 \\u00d7 10 4 cell/well) were treated for 3 days with different concentrations of ATV or RDV (ranging from 1 to 600 \\u00b5M) as previously described by us [8, 44] . The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) was calculated by a non-linear regression analysis from a dose-response curve. All experiments were carried out at least three independent times and each data was analyzed from Prism GraphPad software 8.0 (Windows GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The results were presented as mean \\u00b1 standard deviation (SD). The selectivity indexes (SI) for ATV and RDV were calculated through the ratio between CC 50 and EC 50 values.ATV's concentration in the plasma and lungs of adult Swiss-Webster mice (8-15 weeks) was evaluated over time. Animals were treated with an oral dose of 60 mg/kg of ATV for 12-time intervals-00:05, 00:10, 00:20, 00:40, 01:00, 02:00, 03:00, 04:00, 06:00, 08:00, 10:00 and 12:00 h. Each treatment group had five animals. After these periods of times, total blood and lungs were collected. Plasma was obtained by blood centrifugation at 8000\\u00d7 g for 15 min. Experiments with transgenic mice expressing human ACE-2 receptor (K18-hACE2mice), were performed in Animal Biosafety Level 3 (ABSL-3) multiuser facility, according to the animal welfare guidelines of the Ethics Committee of Animal Experimentation (CEUA-INCa, License 005/2021) and WHO guidelines [34] . The animals were obtained from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation breeding colony and maintained with free access to food and water at 29-30 \\u2022 C under a controlled 12 h light/dark cycle. Experiments were performed during the light phase of the cycle.For infection procedures, mice were anaesthetized with 60 mg/kg of ketamine and 4 mg/kg of xylazine and inoculated intranasally with DMEM high glucose (MOCK), or 10 5 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 gamma strain in 10 \\u00b5L of DMEM high glucose. It was used six mice per experimental group: MOCK (non-infected); SARS-CoV-2-infected without treatment (NIL) and SARS-CoV-2-infected and treated with ATV. The animals were treated with a daily dose of 60 mg/kg of ATV for seven days.The animals were monitored daily during seven days for survival and body-weight analysis. In the case of weight loss higher than 20% euthanasia was performed to alleviate animal suffering. In the last day, the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from both lungs was harvested by washing the lungs once with 1 mL of cold PBS. After centrifugation of BAL (1500 rpm for 5 min), the pellet was used for total and differential leukocytes counts (diluted in Turk's 2% acetic acid fluid) using a Neubauer chamber. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) quantification was performed with centrifuged BAL supernatant to evaluated cell death (CytoTox96, Promega). Differential cell counts were performed by cytospin (Cytospin3; centrifugation of 350\\u00d7 g for 5 min at room temperature) and stained by the May-Gr\\u00fcnwald-Giemsa method.After BAL harvesting, lungs were perfused with 20 mL of saline solution to remove the circulating blood. Lungs were then collected, pottered and homogenized in 500 \\u00b5L of a phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktail Complete, mini EDTA-free Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany) for 30 s, using an Ultra-Turrax Disperser T-10 basic IKA (Guangzhou, China).The viral RNA from samples collected in the in vivo assays was quantified through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Total RNA was extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), according to manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using Quanti Tect Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) in a StepOne Plus\\u2122 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Amplifications were carried out in 15 \\u00b5L reaction mixtures containing 2\\u00d7 reaction mix buffer, 50 \\u00b5M of each primer, 10 \\u00b5M of the probe and 5 \\u00b5L of RNA template. Primers, probes and cycling conditions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol were used to detect the SARS-CoV-2 (CDC 2020). Amplification of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a reference for the number of cells. The cycle threshold (CT) values for this target were compared to those obtained with different cell quantities (10 7 to 10 2 ), for calibration.The levels of IL-6, TNF-\\u03b1, KC and PF4 were quantified in BAL samples from uninfected (MOCK), infected without treatment (NIL) and infected and treated animals by ELISA, using specific kits and following the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems). Cell death was determined according to the activity of LDH in the BAL as previously described in the Section 4.8.Histological features related to the injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed in the lungs of K18-hACE2 mice. Inflammatory and vascular infiltrates and evidence of cell degeneration was evaluated to characterize the level of the tissue damage. The collected material was fixed with formaldehyde (4%), dehydrated and embedded in paraffin to the obtention of tissue slices through the use of a microtome. The slices were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for microphotographs analysis.Human blood samples were collected from healthy donors in 3.8% trisodium citrate (9:1, v/v), and platelet-poor plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Plasma (100 \\u00b5L) was incubated with 1 \\u00b5L of ATV at various concentrations (diluted in DMSO) for 2 min at 310 K. Plasma clotting was initiated by the addition of 100 \\u00b5L of 25 mM CaCl 2 , and the time for clot formation was recorded on a KC-4 Delta coagulometer (Tcoag, Wicklow, Ireland). Time for clot formation was recorded in triplicates.The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/ 10.3390/ph15010021/s1, Figure S1 : Chemical structure for (A) PF-07321332 and (B) ritonavir, the active principles of PAXLOVID TM from Pfizer.

The second challenge was to identify the main stakeholders and their strategies to address different COVID-19 countermeasures.The empirical research is based on a large pool of data. The data was collected on four routes in France where competition was expected for train services in 2020, in line with market liberalization. Notably, because the COVID-19 crisis was not anticipated, the initial purpose of the data collection was to assess the effect of train liberalization on the current train market as well as on the other modes of transport in terms of price and frequency.Consequently, the data collection started in September 2019 and was still active in December 2021 for four modes: coach, carpooling, 1 train, and air. The analysis is based on time series from September 2019 to October 2021. Prices and frequencies are discussed as the main variables on an aggregated scale for all modes then mode per mode.Finally, the intensity of the competition is analyzed on two scales: intramodal and intermodal. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is used to assess the level of competition through market concentration (Lipczynski et al., 2017) .The main results have to be considered carefully as the pandemic is ongoing as of the end of 2021. However, the progress of the vaccination programs in Europe and France during the second part of 2021 suggests a return to a normal state of the market. The first finding was the severe crisis in terms of supply during the first lockdown in March 2020. Throughout the rest of 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 countermeasures had progressively less impact, and services increased slowly, with rail and carpooling recovering to a level similar to their 2019 levels. However, thisis not yet the case for coach and air services. The second finding is that the market is concentrated to the advantage of the dominant mode, rail services, especially in comparison to air services, which are the main challenger for long-distance trips. Air services still face difficulties recovering, mainly because of reduction in the business market.The third finding highlights the persistence of conventional services during the different lockdowns and the high variability of low-cost services, which disappeared during the crisis. However, no operator went bankrupt or left the market during the crisis, mainly thanks to public support. Moreover, low-cost services recovered faster in September-October 2021 than conventional services, thereby increasing their market share. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in greater intramodal competition, mainly between the incumbent and challengers in each mode. The last finding reveals the crisis in the business market (Caputo et al., 2021) caused by alternatives to business travel (such as videoconferencing and teleworking). This crisis may explain the challenges conventional services face when confronted by low-cost services better adapted to the leisure market. Additionally, it suggests a new paradigm of work and travel based on the development of alternatives to physical mobility. It confirms the concept of a \\\"new normal\\\" and questions public national incumbents' business models, which are traditionally dependent on business users.There are several practical implications for policymakers and operators. First, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the key role public national incumbents play during a crisis in ensuring a minimal service when other operators stop running as well as providing specific services, like sanitary trains in France. Second, there is a risk that the end of public financial support will transform the long-distance transport market into \\\"business for survival\\\" as the sector is highly sensitive to COVID-19 countermeasures and has become more competitive, mainly because of reduced demand (especially from the business market). Finally, most of the market segments are duopolies, so there is a high risk of monopolies developing if challenger operators go bankrupt. Public regulators must remain vigilant in the immediate future regarding the effects of COVID-19 countermeasures and public financial support to avoid greater market concentration. This paper is structured in six sections. Section 2 presents the motivations underlying the French case and the context for long-distance services. Section 3 describes the data collection and method. Section 4 gives the general results, after which Section 5 discusses them mode by mode. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.There are several reasons for selecting France as a case study. First, the French market is characterized by a wide variety of services for long-distance travel, from rail services to carpooling, as described in Subsection 2.1. Subsection 2.2 shows that during the pandemic, France, like other European countries, imposed strict sanitary regulations and multiple lockdowns as well as other restrictions, affecting long-distance travel. Finally, Subsection 2.3 highlights the crisis's severe impact on demand for travel and transport companies.The French case is interesting due to the wide choice of transport services available on long-distance routes. Laroche and Lamatkhanova (2021) showed that the diversity of services in the French market is similar to Germany's, Italy's, and the UK's. The services are predominantly train, coach, carpooling, and air. Consequently, analyzing the French market can offer insights into trends in other markets after considering certain specificities of the French market.First, most segments of the long-distance travel market are either duopolies or monopolies. Second, some of them are quite new and were still consolidating when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Third, low-cost services are well established in the market.More specifically, train services are still a monopoly run by the national incumbent, SNCF. The initial competitors were expected in 2020, but the first lockdown and other countermeasures delayed project until the end of 2021.However, the high-speed market can be characterized as an innovative service, because SNCF was the first European operator to develop the concept of low-cost high-speed services (called Ouigo) in 2013. It is interesting to distinguish low-cost services (Ouigo) from traditional services (inOui) and analyze the internal competition between the two. Air services are a duopoly for long-distance trips (journeys that are three hours longer by rail) and a monopoly for shorter trips. The national incumbent is traditionally Air France, which competes with easyJet. The coach market is relatively new in France in so far as it has only been open to competition since 2015 (Blayac & Bougette, 2017) . One of the first players was Flixbus. There were several competitors in the early years but, confronted by the consolidation of the market, most are now limited to niche markets. There were two main competitors at the beginning of 2020 before the first lockdown: Flixbus and BlaBlaBus. BlaBlaBus can be considered a challenger, and its history is original. Launched by the national train company (SNCF) in 2014 (as iDBUS), the company was bought by BlaBlaCar, the French leader in carpooling services, in 2019 with the aim of becoming a multimodal actor in the passenger transport market. Lastly, BlaBlaCar is a carpooling services success story in France and Europe. Established in 2006, it boasted 100 million members in 2021 (Business Insider France, 2021).The next sections consider the effect of COVID-19 on transport overall and on each of the four modes individually.Another motivating factor to examine the French case is the French government's decision to counter COVID-19 with a wide range of regulations. Figure 1 illustrates the chronology of these regulations from 2020 to 2021.The first lockdown was imposed in March 2020, some days after Italy but in line with the majority of other European countries. For eight weeks-from March 17, 2020, to May 11, 2020-mobility was curtailed to one hour per day within a one kilometer radius of one's residence with a pass. From May 11, 2020, to May 28, 2020, the restrictions on local mobility were loosened but stayed restrictive for long-distance mobility, with journeys limited to 100 kilometers for essential reasons only. Long-distance transport services were particularly impacted by these F I G U R E 1 Timeline of the COVID-19 countermeasures in France. Source: Author restrictions. Summer 2020 was unique for several reasons. On the surface, it looked like a \\\"normal\\\" summer; however, the public were obliged to wear masks in public, including on transport, potentially negatively impacting longdistance services. In addition, the limitation of international trips and the rising \\\"fear of social contact\\\" changed mobility behaviors and habits that summer, especially regarding long-distance journeys. The COVID-19 countermeasures of summer 2020 (a lower level of restriction but permanent sanitary regulations, such as the use of masks) persisted until early September, when universities reopened their doors and invited students to travel long distances to be physically present in the classroom after six months of online courses. Unfortunately, the number of COVID-19 cases increased drastically that autumn, leading the French government to implement the second lockdown from October 30, 2020, to December 15, 2020. Prior to the second lockdown, there was a period of curfews from nine p.m. until six p.m. in the most infected localities.The second lockdown was similar to the first. Trips were limited to one kilometer from one's residence for one hour a day with a pass. Additionally, a curfew throughout mainland France was implemented from six p.m. Once again, long-distance services were deeply impacted. Universities closed their doors until summer 2021, and teleworking became the norm for millions of workers. Although the second lockdown was lifted in December 2020, restrictions remained very strict throughout winter 2021, with the national six p.m. curfew and the closure of restaurants, bars, and ski resorts. The third lockdown was ordered from April 3, 2021, to May 3, 2021. Since then, the restrictions have been progressively alleviated, and the curfew ended on June 30, 2021. Summer 2021 was characterized by the permanence of restrictions, like mask-wearing, and the introduction of a vaccination pass, excluding non-vaccinated people from certain modes of transport (air and train), restaurants, and other places. ByOctober 2021, 70% of the French population had been vaccinated against COVID-19, making it possible to return to \\\"normal\\\" life. The mass teleworking policy was removed, and universities reopened. This research compares autumn 2021 to September-October 2019 to assess the effects of eighteen months of restrictions and verify if a \\\"new normal\\\" has emerged from this period.To conclude, long-distance services have been particularly impacted by the different measures to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. This is because long-distance trips were prohibited for many months for the majority of the French population, plus the closure of universities and mass teleworking resulted in no demand from the student and business markets.This last subsection highlights the effect of COVID-19 on demand for long-distance transport services. It also compares the French trends to the European averages. From a general point of view, the collapse in demand for long-distance transport services in France is similar to the rest of Europe. For France's train market, demand decreased by 41% in 2020 compared to 2019 and by 48% on average in Europe (IRG-Rail, 2021). The situation was similar for air, with a decrease of 67% for Air France and \\\"only\\\" 46% for easyJet. The average in Europe was slightly higher with a decrease of 73% in 2020 compared to 2019 (Eurostat, 2021) . For both modes, teleworking and fewer business travelers deeply impacted the overall dynamic (Caputo et al., 2021) .For coach services, demand decreased by 65% over the period (Autorit\\u00e9 de R\\u00e9gulation des Transports, 2021b).Carpooling services were less affected by the collapse in demand than other modes of transport with \\\"only\\\" a 25% reduction in demand (V\\u00e9rier, 2021) . It is possible that the user profile for carpooling is less sensitive to COVID-19 because of age or another factor.Finally, it is interesting to consider that traffic on France's high-speed roads increased by 7.6% during summer 2021 compared to summer 2019 according to Vinci Autoroute (Investir, 2021) . This finding suggests that long-distance trips experienced a similar behavioral change as urban mobility, where an increase in car use has been observed (Klein et al., 2021; Macharis, 2021) .Subsection 3.1 presents the study's parameters. Details of the data collection are described in Subsection 3.2, and Subsection 3.3 explains the method.The analysis is based on four main routes in France as shown in Figure 2 : Paris-Lyon, Paris-Bordeaux, Paris-Toulouse, and Paris-Nice.The initial research question was about the effect of a new competitor on long-distance train travel; therefore, these four routes were selected because a new train operator was expected to challenge the incumbent in the context of market liberalization in 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the introduction of competition and necessitated changing the research question.The four routes were also chosen in the hope of including routes with different characteristics, like travel time.Lyon and Bordeaux are less than three hours from Paris, while Toulouse and Nice are more than three hours from the capital. Consequently, the Toulouse and Nice are served by more flights but fewer trains and other services, like carpooling and coaches. Moreover, the Paris-Lyon route is one of the most used high-speed lines in Europe, serving more than 44 million travelers in 2019.F I G U R E 2 Study parameters. Source: AuthorData were collected every Tuesday since September 2019 on each route and for four modes of transport: train, air, coach, and carpooling. Tuesday was selected for its representativeness during the week. The collection was performed one week before the departure date except for carpooling because of the high variation of supply at the last minute. In this case, collection was performed one day before to consider more than 90% of the supply.The data collection concerned each mode and each service (only direct travel without connections) during the day, and looked at price, schedule, and travel time. In total, the data cover 87 days and comprise more than 14,000 observations 2 between September 2019 and October 2021.The main sources given in Table 1 are the websites dedicated to the different modes. Most of them are comparators because of the competition between operators. The two exceptions are for train and carpooling where the markets are monopolies. For rail, we used the SNCF's commercial website where all the train offerings are presented. For carpooling, there are several operators but only one drives the market; therefore, BlaBlaCar's website was the reference for carpooling. For the other modes, comparators were used. For air, Google Flights gave a full overview of supply, while the European website Omio.fr was used for coach services.The method is based on time series and a descriptive analysis. The times series are given from September 2019 to October 2021. The variations between 2019 and 2021 are calculated on the basis of two reference months:September and October.The main variables used to give an overview of the market evolution are price, number of seats, and number of services (frequency).The price is given as an average price per kilometer for each mode or service. The number of seats is given per day for each mode and service. It is based on the number of seats per service and their frequency during the day.The number of seats can change from one service to another according to its characteristics. This is especially true for train services. For example, a low-cost service proposes 634 seats versus 510 for a conventional high-speed rail service (Autorit\\u00e9 de R\\u00e9gulation des Transports, 2021a). There is less heterogeneity for the other modes. The standard number of seats for a coach service is 50, 3 165 for a standard Airbus A320, 4 and four at most per car for a car.Finally, the frequency is based on the number of services a day.Competition is assessed via the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. It is a well-known index usually used to assess a market's concentration (Lipczynski et al., 2017) . It is based on each operator's market share. In this study, the 2 One observation corresponds to one service one way for one schedule.3 https://location.flixbus.fr/services/location-bus-places#:$:text=Location%20de%20bus%2036%20%2D%2050,bus%20qu'il%20vous%20faut. 4 https://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/airbus-a320/2-les-nombreux-heritiers-de-l-a320/#:$:text=L'A320%2C%20qui%20se%20d%C3%A9cline, hauteur%20de%2011%2C76%20m%C3%A8tres. Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is calculated on the basis of the number of seats for each mode or type of service per day. It is the best indicator to give a realistic view of the level of concentration within a market taking into account the capacity of each mode and frequency of the services.The results are split into two sections. Subsection 4.1 gives an overview of the COVID-19 effects in terms of price and capacity, while Subsection 4.2 focuses on the effects of the pandemic on each mode of transport.The the market (respectively, 0.4% and 2.2% in 2019), rail increased its market share, while air services fell from 17% in 2019 to 13% in 2021. The first lockdown was very severe for air services, when the market share dropped to 4.6% before recovering to around 11% during the two other lockdowns. Nevertheless, the situation remains difficult for air services. For the other modes, it is interesting to consider that carpooling has been more consistent than the other modes with a modal share between 0.4% and 0.2%. However, coach services have been significantly impacted with the stoppage of services during the second and third lockdowns, resulting in rail services taking a greater share of the market.According to Figure 5 , the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index increased by 9.8% over the period, with a peak during the first lockdown, placing the rail incumbent in a dominant position within the market. Figure 6 shows that rail can be observed, especially for coach services, who are well known for their flexibility, but also for rail and air. To conclude, the return of rail services to their initial capacity may hide a lower utilization rate of rail than in 2019. This situation could limit the market power of rail services, particularly in terms of prices.Regarding price, COVID-19 has had unexpected effects. Figure 7 the modes. They decreased during the first and second lockdowns but increased during the third. This can be explained by the significant reduction in supply and state financial support to maintain a minimal service during the first two lockdowns. Concerning train services, it is interesting that the average price per kilometer was similar to that for carpooling. It can provide from the development of the low-cost offer whose the extinction can have a positive effect of prices (increase) as during the three lockdowns. Nevertheless, it is notable that the train incumbent did not benefit from its dominant position within the market by increasing prices. Regarding carpooling prices, the reduction could be related to the price of oil, which dropped in 2020 (INSEE, 2020) . Prices should increase in the next month as oil prices rise. Finally, coach services increased their prices after their services were paused during the lockdowns. Subsection 4.2 highlights the sector's difficulties in finding economic equilibrium.This subsection focuses on each mode's prices and frequency.Rail services can be split into two types: the conventional high-speed rail service (inOui) and the low-cost high-speed rail service (Ouigo). From a general standpoint, Figure 9 shows that the first lockdown dramatically impacted both services. The conventional high-speed rail service almost completely stopped its services, reducing them from an average of 13 trains per day to two, while the low-cost services stopped running altogether. The effect of the subsequent two lockdowns was less severe, although both times traffic was halved, and the low-cost services were more impacted than the conventional high-speed rail trains. However, the low-cost services' market share increased significantly from 2019 to 2021. The average number of conventional high-speed rail trains per day decreased by almost 15% but the number of low-cost high-speed rail trains increased by 30%. The result was a substitution of F I G U R E 8 Detailed price per mode (in \\u20ac per km). Source: Author conventional high-speed rail services for low-cost high-speed rail services and a bigger market share for low-cost high-speed rail (from 22% in 2019 to 30% in 2021). The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index decreased by 10% during the period, pointing to greater competition between the two services and a form of internal \\\"home-made\\\" competition.Concerning prices for train services, analysis is difficult because of yield management practices. Figure 10 shows that prices seemed to be more sensitive to the summer holidays than the lockdowns. Nevertheless, it is interesting to observe that prices decreased by 17% and 16%, respectively, for conventional high-speed rail and low-cost highspeed rail between 2019 and 2021. This result was unexpected in so far as the concentration of the market increased in favor of rail services during that period. At least two explanations can be given. First, the overall reduced demand generated overcapacity and put pressure on prices. This is clear for the conventional high-speed rail where frequency and prices were reduced during the period. The severe crisis in the business market linked to teleworking and videoconferencing is an explanation. Second, the train market was opened to competition in 2020. With two years of delay, the first competitors should enter the market at the end of 2021. From this perspective, the incumbent has an interest in moderating prices for conventional high-speed rail services and improving its low-cost services in order to be competitive.Air services are split between two operators. The national company, Air France, traditionally runs conventional services in opposition to easyJet, the well-known low-cost company. As shown in Figure 11 , the first lockdown had whereas easyJet's only dropped by 14%. The market share for low-cost services increased from 30% in October 2019 to 40% in October 2021, and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index fell by 8%, pointing to a higher level of competition within the market. As with conventional rail services, Air France's difficulties in returning to its initial level may be a sign of crisis in the business market, whereas easyJet is in a better situation thanks to its strong position in the leisure market supported by its low-price policy.Regarding prices, as with rail, yield management practices limit the analysis, especially during the lockdowns.However, Figure 12 highlights a strong divergence between Air France's and easyJet's strategies. Between 2019 and 2021, Air France increased its prices by 9%, while easyJet decreased theirs by 50%. As reported in Figure 12 , easyJet has an aggressive strategy of increasing supply and decreasing prices, while Air France seems to have difficulties in keeping its offerings competitive. To conclude, the low-cost services seem to have increased their market share after two years of COVID-19. This last point will be discussed further in Section 5. Figure 12. The coach market is characterized by a duopoly between two companies: Flixbus and BlaBlaBus. Whereas for rail and air services it is possible to distinguish a conventional company from a low-cost one, this is not the case for the Figure 13 presents these characteristics. Both operators adopted a similar strategy during the three lockdowns with a shutdown of their services. Flixbus had a small advantage between the second and the third lockdown as it remained alone on the market. From a general standpoint, Flixbus seems to have performed better between 2019 and 2021 than BlaBlaBus.In 2019, BlaBlaBus had a greater market share than Flixbus (49% versus 38%, respectively), but the situation reversed in September-October 2021 when Flixbus had 62% of the market versus BlaBlaBus's 18%. However, it is important to note that the frequencies are highly variable and sensitive to demand. According to Blayac and Bougette (2020) , this is a competitive advantage inherent in their business model. It can be defined as a two-sided market (Rochet & Tirole, 2003) based on a digital platform where the offer (coach companies' services) matches demand. Both companies have no buses of their own, meaning they are able to adapt their capacity and prices to meet demand. The carpooling market is unique for several reasons. First, there is only one operator for long-distance trips,BlaBlaCar. Other platforms tried to develop alternative services without success. Since 2021, BlaBlaCar can be considered the dominant digital platform for carpooling services. Second, BlaBlaCar is a digital platform where car drivers are free to share their trip and fix their price according to a limit set by the platform (calculated on the distance and based on gasoline price and tolls). Economically speaking, BlaBlaCar's business model can be defined as a two-sided market with a strong position in the long-distance market. Consequently, Figure 15 does not show planned conventional offerings but the results of an aggregate of drivers willing to share their trips. The offerings are very varied, and the peaks are strongly dependent on the holiday periods during winter (Christmas) and summer.The COVID-19 pandemic had two interesting effects on supply. First, traffic stopped during the first lockdown and significantly decreased during the other two. Second, drivers' behavior seems to have changed between 2020 and 2021. Although summer 2020 saw a classic peak, summer 2021 showed below-usual performance levels, and the overall supply fell by 6% between 2019 and 2021. The first explanation could be the simple evolution of the demand for transportation. Considering that the carpooling offer is dependent on the willingness of drivers to make trips, the carpooling supply is certainly the best indicator for assessing the level of demand for long-distance transport. Consequently, it is possible to assume that demand decreased between 2019 and 2021, especially in the leisure market. This could also explain the reduction in supply for other modes. The second explanation can be linked to the fear of social contact. This psychological effect of COVID-19, based on the fear of being infected, has been identified F I G U R E 1 5 Carpooling frequency (average number of cars per day). Source: Author F I G U R E 1 6 Average carpooling price per kilometer (per day). Source: Author regarding other modes of transport (Aaditya & Rahul, 2021) . Finally, the last assumption is based on gasoline prices.They decreased during 2020 before increasing in summer 2021. As the value of drivers' time is very high because of the cost of organizing the services, it is possible that the service has become less attractive to drivers. Figure 16 supports this hypothesis. Prices dropped by 26% throughout the period, before increasing in October 2021. If prices are linked to the price of gasoline, they did not change significantly during the summer when oil prices were already increasing.This last section discusses two further aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-distance services. Subsection 5.1proposes a spatial approach based on an analysis of seat capacities route by route. Subsection 5.2 further questions the results regarding the increase of low-cost services.In Section 4, the results were analyzed by mode of transport. In this section, the objective is to provide an analysis per route to identify the potential spatial effect of COVID-19 countermeasures in France. We recall that the data is based on the following four routes: Paris-Lyon, Paris-Bordeaux, Paris-Toulouse, and Paris-Nice. Each route has specific characteristics. First, distance is a key parameter for distinguishing them. Lyon and Bordeaux are closer to Paris (466 kilometers and 586 kilometers, respectively) than Toulouse and Nice (677 kilometers and 933 kilometers, respectively). A second characteristic is the metropolitan population. Lyon is the biggest (1.3 million inhabitants), Bordeaux and Toulouse are similar (749,595 and 783,353 inhabitants, respectively), and Nice is the smallest (550,000 inhabitants). Finally, their accessibility is heterogenic. Lyon and Bordeaux are directly linked to Paris by a high-speed line, while Toulouse and Nice are still outside the high-speed rail network. Consequently, the travel time by train to these destinations is longer, and air services to them are more developed. Considering this, it is interesting to compare these routes and identify the potential effect of COVID-19 on seat capacities. Figure 17 highlights the effect of COVID-19 on seat capacities for the four routes. The first comment is the effect of distance on seat capacities. The Paris-Lyon route is the shortest and offers the highest number of seats.The considerable difference in 2019 with Bordeaux can be explained by the fact that Lyon is larger than Bordeaux.Otherwise, Toulouse and Nice are similar in terms of supply. Toulouse has a small advantage due to its closer proximity to Paris and bigger metropolitan area. The results are in line with the standard theory of the gravity model (Hansen, 1959) . Concerning the effect of COVID-19, the reduction in the number of seats was similar for Lyon and Bordeaux (\\u00c073% and \\u00c072%, respectively) but very different for Toulouse and Nice (\\u00c051% and \\u00c090%, respectively).In this case, it is difficult to draw a general conclusion. The second lockdown had less of an impact than the first but that is highly heterogenic according to location. The effect of the latter lockdown was unexpected with a stronger effect on short distances (respectively, \\u00c054% for Lyon and \\u00c052% for Bordeaux) and a lower effect on longer distances (respectively \\u00c034% for Toulouse and \\u00c026% for Nice). Finally, all the destinations lost seat capacity in September-October 2021 in comparison to 2019. Nevertheless, the two shortest distances lost less capacity than the two others. Lyon and Bordeaux reduced their seat capacities by 5.7% and 9.5%, respectively, while Toulouse and Nice reduced them by 17.5% and 18%, respectively. The higher reduction for the latter two can be attributed to the difficulties air services faced in returning to their initial level of service. Furthermore, the better performance of Lyon and Bordeaux can be linked to the good performance of rail services as discussed in Section 4. To conclude, the cities that are not linked to the high-speed rail network or who are far from the main city (more than three hours away) have suffered more from the effect of COVID-19 than the others in terms of supply.The aforementioned results highlighted a possible increase in low-cost services for rail and air modes between 2019 and 2021. This last section tests this finding. Figure 18 compares the evolution of conventional and low-cost supplies for air and rail in terms of frequency. In September and October 2019, there were on average 120 conventional trains and flights per day for the routes investigated and 30 low-cost trains and flights. The modal share of low-cost services was around 25%. The first lockdown had a dramatic effect on both traditional and low-cost services but impacted low-cost services more. All lowcost air and rail services stopped, whereas conventional services were merely reduced. The two other lockdowns had less impact on overall traffic. However, low-cost services were still more affected than conventional ones. During the second lockdown, frequency decreased by 42% for conventional services versus 82% for low-cost services.During the last lockdown, the decrease was 38% for conventional services versus 52% for low-cost services. This confirms the greater flexibility of low-cost services, although in the case of serious crisis, the pursual of the service offer has been guaranted of service continuity.In September-October 2021, there were on average 34 low-cost services a day versus 87 for the conventional offer. There are several lessons here. First, the number of low-cost services did not increase by much (+5.5%). They regained their pre-COVID-19 levels. Second, the full service offer decreased by 28.5% over the period. Traditional air and rail services remain are far below their initial level with only 87 services per day versus 120 in 2019.F I G U R E 1 8 Average low-cost offer for rail and air per route and day versus the full service offer. Source: Author Consequently, the low-cost market share increased, but the analysis confirms that there has not been an overall increase in low-cost services. There appear to be more low-cost services because the conventional offer is still far below its initial level.To conclude, Figure 19 shows the ratio between low-cost services and conventional services for rail and air to the previous results were driven by one or the other. For both air and rail, the ratio was higher in 2021 than in 2019, which confirms the previous results. If the ratio were higher in 2019 for air, signifying a larger market share for lowcost services than for rail, it was the opposite in 2021. However, the ratio for air almost returned to the difference with rail in 2021, illustrating easyJet's aggressive strategy. It also confirms the severe crisis conventional services, traditionally driven by business trips, face (Caputo et al., 2021 ). An analysis of demand and supply would be an interesting addition to this research to further explore the effect of COVID-19 on the evolution of travel behaviors.The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the implementation of strict regulations all over the world, an unprecedented development in peacetime. These regulations significantly impacted long-distance transportation by limiting individuals' capacity to travel both between countries and within them. At the same time, behaviors changed to adapt to the lack of physical mobility, such as the rise of teleworking and videoconferencing. This study examined the effects of these regulations on long-distance transport services. France was selected as the case study because of the difficulty in obtaining international data and the country's large variety of services (rail, air, coach, and carpooling) as well as its representativeness in terms of COVID-19 countermeasures (including three lockdowns).There are several main findings, but these must be considered with caution because the pandemic, at the time of writing in November 2021, is ongoing. The first finding is the severe crisis in terms of supply during the first lockdown in March 2020. The subsequent COVID-19 countermeasures and lockdowns during the rest of 2020 and 2021 had progressively less impact on long-distance transport, and services increased slowly until rail and carpooling services were close to their 2019 levels (though coach and air services have not yet recovered to this point).The second finding is that the market is concentrated to the advantage of the dominant mode, rail services. Air services are the main challenger for long-distance trips but face difficulties in recovering their activity mainly because of the reduction in business travel.The last finding highlights the persistence of conventional services during the different lockdowns and the high variability of low-cost services, which disappeared during the crisis. However, it is interesting to consider two facts.F I G U R E 1 9 The ratio of low-cost services to classic services for train and air. Source: Author First, no operator went bankrupt during the crisis or withdrew from a route, mainly thanks to state financial support.Second, low-cost services were recovering faster in September-October 2021 than conventional services, finally increasing their market share in the air, rail, and coach markets. The crisis in the business market can explain the difficulty for conventional services confronted by low-cost ones better adapted to the leisure market. In addition, the effect is higher intramodal competition predominantly between the incumbent and challengers in each mode. Finally, the spatial approach highlights the greater resilience of long-distance travel services serving cities connected to the high-speed rail network that are close to the main cities. The cities that are not linked to the high-speed rail network or that are far from the main city (more than three hours away) have suffered more from the effects of COVID-19 than the others in terms of supply.The results show that the concept of a \\\"new normal\\\" could be applied to the French long-distance travel market considering the structural reduction of the business market. It suggests a new paradigm of work and mobility based on the development of alternatives to physical mobility (such as videoconferencing and teleworking). Moreover, the shrinking business market presents a huge challenge for the public national incumbents (SNCF, Air France) because their business models depend on business users.There are several practical implications for policymakers and operators. First of all, the COVID-19 crisis highlights the key role public national incumbents play during a crisis to ensure a minimum level of service when other operators stop their activities. They also played a key role in providing specific services, like sanitary trains in France.Second, there is a risk that the end of the state financial support will transform long-distance travel business into \\\"business for survival\\\" as the sector is highly sensitive to the effects of COVID-19 countermeasures and is still weakened by the reduction of the business market. Furthermore, most of the market segments are duopolies. There is a risk of monopolies developing should an operator go bankrupt. The public regulators must remain vigilant in the next few months regarding the effect of COVID-19 countermeasures and state financial support to avoid higher concentration within the markets. Finally, the current market evolution with fewer air services could be an interesting trend for the future, considering the objective of carbon neutrality in France and Europe by 2050. The reduction of the business market can be a relevant lever for at least two reasons. First, it may be easier to find alternatives to physical travel (such as videoconferencing) for business trips than for leisure or family trips. Second, business demand prioritizes frequency over price. A reduction of the business segment could favor fewer trains and flights per day but conversely a better utilization rate and commercial capacity thanks to the low-cost model, leading to environmental benefits.https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9961-1159\",\n          \"The lipidome is defined as the complete set of lipids present within a cell, a tissue, or an organism [1, 2] . In the last decades, it has become clear that the lipidome, as well as the transcriptome and the proteome, is in a dynamic balance and it can be affected by physio-pathological conditions, stimuli, and changes in diet [3, 4] . Lipidomics is a relatively new \\\"-omics\\\" that characterizes, identifies, and quantifies the lipidome and its metabolic pathways and other networks that are involved within different biological mechanisms [5] . With analytical approaches, such as thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and gas chromatography (GC), lipidomics was able to develop new diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies [6] ; but it was with the advent of the next-generation mass spectrometry (MS) that there have been significant advances in the field of lipidomics [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In a typical lipidomic workflow, lipids are extracted from the biological matrices using organic solvents and analyzed by direct infusion into a mass spectrometer (technique known as \\\"shotgun\\\" lipidomics), or separated by liquid (LC) or gas chromatography (GC), prior to detection by MS. These two approaches are complementary, since the \\\"shotgun\\\" method allows a larger lipid profiling by simultaneous identification of several classes of lipids, meanwhile LC or GC/MS enable a more targeted analysis with the detection of structurally similar lipids belonging to a single class [12] [13] [14] . In both methods, the quantification is performed using a ratio against internal standard(s), which is routinely added for sample normalization and matrix effect influence correction. Internal standard structures and physicochemical properties are representative of the endogenous lipid species of interest and are added at the earliest possible step during sample preparation. For shotgun lipidomics, a semiquantification is generally possible by using exogenous lipids representative of the main lipid classes of interest; whereas for targeted lipidomics, labeled lipids (i.e., deuterated internal standards) should be included for absolute quantification. In the last few years, the aforementioned advanced analytical techniques have led to multiple improvements in lipidomics, particularly in the extraction methods and bioinformatics. These enhancements have allowed important goals, such as the identification of several lipid-based biomarkers, useful as diagnostic tools [5, 10] . However, the number of lipidomics studies in the field of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remains rather limited, especially when compared to the numerous investigations about their transcriptome and proteome. Thus, the objective of the current review was to focus on recently highlighted roles of specific bioactive lipid species and their involvement in the MSCs-related inflammatory scenario.MSCs are non-hematopoietic multipotent progenitor cells with the ability to differentiate into different mesodermal lineages including osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes [15, 16] . The three criteria adopted by the International Society for Cellular Therapy to define and identify MSCs are: (1) MSCs must be adherent to plastic under standard culture conditions;(2) their phenotypes must present the expression of CD105, CD73, and CD90 and lack the expression of the hematopoietic cell surface markers CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79\\u03b1, or CD19 and HLA-DR; (3) they must be able to differentiate under stimulation in vitro into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondroblasts [17, 18] . MSCs are currently being studied in many preclinical and clinical applications. In particular, they have attracted the scientific interest for their ability to regulate inflammatory processes and promote tissue repair due to their multi-lineage differentiation potential, pro-angiogenic characteristics, and immune-modulatory properties [19] [20] [21] . Recently, MSC-based treatment has been proposed as a suitable therapeutic approach for the severe acute respiratory infection caused by the corona virus SARS-CoV-2. In the COVID-19 scenario, where the immune system produces large amounts of inflammatory factors, the MSC therapy can prevent the storm release of cytokines by the immune system and promote endogenous repair through their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and reparative properties [22, 23] .Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of MSCs, largely mediated by paracrine signaling [24] , is currently under investigation for several degenerative, autoimmune, and inflammatory disorders, as well as the exact mechanisms underlying their effect [21] . Nevertheless, it is very likely that either a direct cell-cell contact and/or the secretion of soluble factors, including bioactive lipids, and/or extracellular vesicles (EVs) are needed [24] [25] [26] .Generally, MSCs can modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses in vitro and in vivo due to their ability to inhibit T-cell proliferation and dendritic cell maturation, recruit regulatory T-cells, and modulate B-cell functions [21, 27, 28] . Expanded for the first time from human bone marrow (BM), MSCs can also be collected and cultured from several sources including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, or umbilical cord blood and expanded ex vivo for clinical use [29, 30] . Compared to BMs, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have an easier and faster growth in culture, age with a lower rate, maintain the mesenchymal pluripotency and stem cell phenotype even after a high number of passages in culture, and show a great proliferative rate with a consequent relatively high yield (about 2500 fold higher than BM) [15, 16, 31, 32] . Moreover, ASCs have shown a great potential of differentiation into several cellular lineages and a good stability throughout long-term cultures; they are characterized by immunomodulatory properties making them immunosuppressive [30] . Moreover, their secretome presents a mix of cytokines, extracellular matrix molecules and proteases, lipid mediators, hormones, and growth factors that are also involved in the angiogenesis process with a great utility and applicability in wound healing and tissue regeneration [15, [33] [34] [35] . In addition to BMSCs and ASCs, skeletal muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) have been used in clinical trials for the regener-ation and repair of injured tissues, because of their high proliferation rate and their ability to secrete trophic factors promoting endogenous tissues repair [36] ; moreover, MDSCs harvesting consists in micro-biopsies obtained as small skin punctures under local anesthesia [37, 38] . Although they exhibit slow-growing adherent behavior after isolation, MDSCs are characterized by a long-term self-renewal, and an easy differentiation into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes in vitro [37] .Endogenous bioactive lipids cover a pivotal role in very important biological phenomena, such as inflammation, immune regulation, and maintenance of homeostasis [39, 40] . Indeed, defects in their metabolism and unbalanced biosynthesis are involved in the pathogenesis and clinical course of chronic inflammation diseases [39, 40] . Based on their biosynthesis, bioactive lipids can be grouped into different families (Table 1) : polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)-derived mediators (generally known as eicosanoids), endocannabinoids (eCBs), and lysophospholipids (LPLs) [41] . Bioactive lipids derived from PUFA can be further divided into two subgroups: one is represented by \\u03c96 arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 \\u03c96)-derived lipid mediators, including prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes (LTs), thromboxanes (TXs), and lipoxins (LXs); the other includes \\u03c93-PUFA-derived lipid mediators, such as the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 \\u03c93) and the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 \\u03c93), i.e., E-series and D-series resolvins (Rvs), protectins (PDs), and maresins (MaRs), collectively termed \\\"specialized pro-resolving mediators\\\" (SPMs). Except for LXs, \\u03c96-PUFA-derived lipids are pro-inflammatory, in contrast with \\u03c93-PUFA-derived lipids, which act as anti-inflammatory. In detail, SPMs stimulate key cellular events, by acting as agonists, stopping further neutrophil influx and the activation of non-phlogistic responses by macrophages and, therefore, leading to the resolution of the inflammation. ECBs and eCB-like compounds originate from \\u03c96and \\u03c93-PUFA metabolism, but also from saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (SFA and MUFA), such as palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0), or oleic acids (18:1 n9). Nowadays, pro-and anti-inflammatory properties exerted by eCBs and eCB-like compounds are issues of intense research [42, 43] . Finally, membrane-derived bioactive lipids derived from LPLs can be divided into lysoglycerophospholipids (LGPLs) and lysosphingophospholipids (LSLs), based on the presence of glycerol or sphingosine (S) as backbone of their structures. LPLs exert pleiotropic effects such as inflammation, vesicular trafficking, endocytosis, apoptosis, cell migration, and cell-stress responses [44] . In this review, we will outline the biological activities and metabolisms of the major bioactive lipids identified as essential regulators in the complex scenario of inflammation and as players in the immunoregulation exerted by MSCs. LGPLs, LSLsThe group of eicosanoids represents the widest family of bioactive lipids and includes several molecules characterized by the long carbon chain \\u03c96 AA or \\u03c93 EPA and DHA as common precursors. \\u03c96 AA, released from membrane phospholipids firstly via phospholipase A2 and secondarily by phospholipase C, is the substrate for three different enzymes leading to the generation of pleiotropic and heterogenous compounds: (1) cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 (COX-1/2) drive the synthesis of PGs (PGD 2 , PGE 2 , PGI 2 , and PGF 2\\u03b1 ), prostacyclins, and TXs [45, 46] , also known as prostanoids; (2) 5-, 12-and 15-lypooxygenases (5/12/15-LOX) synthetize LTs [47, 48] , lipoxins (LXs) [49] and hydroxyeicosatetraenoids (HETEs) [50] ; (3) P450 epoxygenase generates also HETEs, and epoxyeicosatrienoids (ETEs) [50] . \\u03c93 PUFAs-derived bioactive products are Rvs, PDs, and MaRs. Rvs derive from either EPA or DHA and can be further divided into E-series or D-series, respectively. DHA acts also as a precursor for the biosynthesis of PDs and MaRs ( Figure 1 ). The \\u03c96 eicosanoids play an essential active role in the inflammatory response, such as leukocyte chemotaxis and activation, fever, pain [40] , and are usually associated to acute inflammatory processes and chronic inflammation. Indeed, PGs seem to promote inflammation through several mechanisms such as increasing the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines [51] [52] [53] , enhancing the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, promoting innate immunity response [54] , recruiting leukocytes and activating two distinct T helper subsets, TH1 and TH17 [55, 56] . LTs generally recruit neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, and TH17 lymphocytes, and are responsible for the induction of edema. Vasoconstriction and vasodilatation are promoted instead by TXs and prostacyclins, respectively [57] . On the other hand, the \\u03c93 family seems to have a beneficial impact on inflammation, by acting via different mechanisms, for example by working as substrate competitors able to inhibit the conversion of AA into pro-inflammatory eicosanoids or serving as an alternative substrate to produce less potent LTs, PGs, and TGs. In animal models, Rvs and PDs shorten the resolution of inflammation for certain diseases [41, 58, 59] and can also increase animal survival [60, 61] . Two of the major Rvs, RvD1 and RvD2, have shown in vivo anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution properties, by blocking the neutrophil infiltration in many disorders, such as obesity and pathologies affecting the vascular [62] , renal and dermal systems, and also in processes as wound healing, fibrosis, and pain [60] . Moreover, \\u03c93 PUFAderived mediators that have been found within the inflammatory exudate (RvE1 and PD1) show great anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions both in vitro and in vivo [51, 63] . However, the resolution of inflammation is also mediated by other metabolites of AA [64] . Indeed, PGJ (15-deoxy-delta-13,14-PGJ 2 ), the bioconversion product of PGD 2 , increases during the resolution phase and acts as a brake on inflammation by inducing apoptosis of inflammatory cells [65] . The concentration of the lipoxygenase product LXA 4 (lipoxin A 4 ) is also increased during the resolution phase and acts as a stop signal for the acute response [66] . Finally, AA-derived EETs present anti-inflammatory properties through the suppression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) activation and govern vasorelaxation and fibrinolysis [67] .eCBs are endogenous lipid compounds that can bind G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) in the same way as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of Cannabis sativa. The plant Cannabis sativa and its preparations, marijuana and hashish, are being used for many years for recreational and medical purposes [68] because of the pleasurable effects triggered by THC, modulated by the other major, nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid, called cannabidiol (CBD). Both components possess other important medical properties, such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-emetic (THC), and anxiolytic (CBD). [69] . Thanks to the studies performed on cannabis plants and their peculiar chemical components, researchers were able to discover one of the most intriguing and pleiotropic endogenous signaling systems, the endocannabinoid system (eCBS). eCBs, CB receptors, and the biochemical entities that produce and degrade these lipids, are involved in most aspects of the mammalian physiology and pathology [70] . The compound arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA) [71] , the first isolated ethanolamide of AA, represents a partial agonist of CB receptors, while 2-arachidonoylglicerol (2-AG) (another derivative of AA) [72, 73] , is a full agonist ( Figure 1 ). Both compounds AEA and 2-AG belong to the group of PUFA AA-related lipid mediators, and as CB receptor ligands, they stimulate a variety of bioactivities, including analgesia, catalepsy, hypolocomotion, and hypothermia [68] . Moreover, AEA exhibits anti-inflammatory properties [74] , whereas 2-AG shows both proand anti-inflammatory characteristics [75, 76] . Thus, dysfunctions leading to changes in concentration levels, metabolism, and receptors of eCBs could be related to alterations in homeostasis and to the progression of chronic inflammatory status [77] . Moreover, two metabolically active \\u03c93 fatty acid ethanolamides, N-eicosapentaenoylethanolamine (EPEA) and N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine (DHEA) [78, 79] , have been proposed as additional CB receptor agonists [80] . These \\u03c93 eCBs were found to possess anti-inflammatory properties in macrophages [81] and adipocytes [82] . In addition to CB1 and CB2 receptors, pharmacological studies suggest the presence also of different receptors that can mediate the cannabinoids effects. Indeed, besides AEA, other ethanolamides coming from various longchain fatty acids were discovered, and collectively known as N-acylethanolamines (NAEs). Ethanolamides of SFA and MUFA such as palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids, which are more abundant than AEA in mammals, show no activity for CB receptors, but act on other receptors, like the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\\u03b1 (PPAR\\u03b1), leading to the trigger of biological events including anti-inflammation and appetite suppression [83, 84] . In detail, the PPAR\\u03b1-mediated actions of N-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) include anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-epileptic, and neuroprotective properties [85, 86] . Moreover, PEA could also activate the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPCR55 [87] , one of the discussed candidates as CB3 receptor, even though this agonist activity has not been fully elucidated yet. Another saturated NAE, N-stearoylethanolamide (SEA), was reported to act as an anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory agent and cell growth controller, through still unknown targets [88] [89] [90] . Finally, a variety of eCB-related compounds, containing fatty acid chains conjugated with different polar heads, have been discovered as a result of advancements of the analytical techniques [91, 92] . Within the novel group of lipids generally referred as lipoamino acids, N-arachidonoylglycine (NAGly), the most important member, possesses anti-inflammatory effects by targeting the G-protein coupled receptor GPCR18 [93, 94] , vasorelaxant properties [95] and seems to be involved in cell migration [96] , and inhibition of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) [97] , the AEA inactivating enzyme. Moreover, NAgly might have either a physiological role in the resolution of acute inflammatory response and become a potential therapeutic candidate for the resolution of chronic inflammation, by increasing the production of PGJ and LXA 4 , reducing the migration of inflammatory cells into areas of acute inflammation and inducing the death of inflammatory cells [93] . eCBs are endogenous lipid compounds that can bind G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) in the same way as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of Cannabis sativa. The plant Cannabis sativa and its preparations, LPLs are bioactive signaling lipids consisting of O-acyl chain, generated from phospholipase-mediated hydrolyzation of membrane glycerophospholipids (GPLs) and sphingolipids (SLs). Consequently, LPLs are classified into two main categories: glyceryl-based LPLs (including LPA) and sphingosyl-based (including S1P) with a glycerol or a sphingosine backbone, respectively [98, 99] (Figure 1 ). Several LPLs compounds are asymmetrically distributed in the plasma membrane and are characterized by a polar head group (ethanolamine, choline, inositol, serine) and a hydrophobic tail of carbon chain. LPLs act as signaling mediators by binding seven-transmembrane domain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The two major bioactive LPLs are the well-characterized lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and they play important roles in various physio-pathological processes, including inflammation. LPA, a byproduct of lysophosphaditylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidilinositol (LPI), is a signaling mediator involved in cell renewal, immune response, and inflammatory cascade [100, 101] . LPA can be synthetized both intracellularly and extracellularly by different enzymes and via different pathways, such as autotaxin/ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 2 (ENNP2) and/or phospholipases A1 and A2, whereas its degradation is mediated by lipid phosphate phosphatases 1-3 [102] . Currently, six LPA receptors (LPA 1-6) are known [102] . Recently, LPA is reported to be rapidly formed during the resolution phase of the inflammation and, successively, to be recruited via the common pro-resolving formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2, also known as ALX), which is expressed on T cells and their subsets [103] . On the other hand, SLs, such as ceramides and sphingosines, participate in different stages of inflammation as well, by controlling intracellular trafficking and signaling, cell proliferation, adhesion, vascularization, survival, and apoptosis [104, 105] . In particular, the phosphate forms of sphingolipids, ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) and S1P [106] , are notably associated to inflammatory responses. S1P is synthesized by the intracellular phosphorylation of sphingosine via sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (SK1 and SK2) and degraded by S1P lyase or ceramide synthases. It is involved in the resolution phase (together with C1P) since apoptotic cells present at the inflammation sites attract pro-resolving macrophages via S1P receptor 1 [107] and, additionally, it can act either on COX-2 or NF-kB, whereas C1P acts on phospholipase A2 [102] .Lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in stem cells physiopathology [108] [109] [110] . However, at the moment the number of studies about the lipidome of MSCs is limited, and mainly focused on variations in lipid composition during stem cell proliferation and differentiation [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] (Figure 2) .Recently, profiles of glycerophopholipids (GPLs) present in human BMSCs were assessed from young and old donors and across passages during in vitro culture [111] [112] [113] . In particular, since the clinical use of MSCs demands sequential ex vivo expansion, the determination of GPL profiles through the different steps of the in vitro culture represents a crucial and relevant advancement. In general, long-term culturing could contribute to the decrease of the proliferation and the differentiation potential, shorten the telomers, and accumulate \\u03c96 PUFAs with signaling roles, consequently promoting inflammation [114, 115] . It is well established that membrane GPLs provide precursors for signaling lipids that modulate cellular functions, and small changes in their compositions can lead to significant biological consequences. Kilpinen et al. studied the effect of the donor's age and cell doublings on the profile of GPLs of human BMSCs, demonstrating that an extensive expansion modulates membrane GPLs, by increasing total phosphatidylinositol (PI) and lysophospatidylcholine (LPC). Specifically, the effect was more pronounced when BMSCs were isolated from young donors. Moreover, changes in membrane FAs profile during expansion and senescence of BMSCs was highlighted: the \\u03c96 AA content increased, while \\u03c93 PUFAs (especially DHA) decreased during long-term cultivation, leading to an impair-ment of the immunological functionality [111] . In addition, in the later steps of the process, an increment of the fraction of individual SFA was noticed [111] . A significant modification of membrane FAs composition of MSCs derived from human fetal membranes (FM-MSCs), occurring during in vitro culture, was assessed by Chatgilialoglu et al. [112] . In detail, fresh uncultured FM-MSCs showed variability in their membrane FAs composition, likely due to the genetic diversity and different lifestyle of the donors. This study also reveals that cultured cells have lower proportions of PUFAs than freshly isolated cells showing a great drop in \\u03c96 FAs, counterbalanced by a marked increase in MUFA and \\u03c93 FAs. These data are in contrast with Kilpinen et al. [111] . More recently, a lipidomics profiling analysis during BMSCs culturing passages by Lu et al. investigates the metabolic alteration of various lipid species in the senescence process [113] . They applied an untargeted lipidomics approach based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), which allowed the reduction of the complexity of the matrix and the enhancement of the sensitivity, factors that represent an improvement relative to the previously described shotgun-based methods. The majority of GPLs, as well as SLs, were found to significantly increase across the culturing passages, whereas the PA, PIs, and phosphatidylserines (PSs) levels were lower in aged cells. These findings were largely coherent with previous described studies, except for PI species, which were found to be increased during all the passages [111] . Nevertheless, the reduced amount of PIs is inconsistent with the relative transcriptomics analysis, which showed an increase in the enzymes expression with consequential conversion of PA into PIs suggesting an enhanced PIs biosynthesis activity. Moreover, research on the functional FAs has largely supported regulatory roles for PGs in MSCs proliferation. In particular, PGE 2 increases human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (UCMSCs) proliferation through \\u03b2-catenin-mediated c-Myc and vascular endothelial growth factor expression via exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac1)/Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1)/Akt and PKA cooperation [116] , and through interaction of profilin-1 (Pfn-1) and filamentousactin (F-actin) via EP2 receptor-dependent \\u03b2-arrestin-1/JNK signaling pathways [117] . On the contrary, the investigation of PGE 2 and prostaglandin D2 (PGD 2 ) effects on MSCs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation suggests that both their receptors are highly expressed in these cells and both prostaglandins seem to have a negative impact [118] . In detail, PGE 2 firstly enhances the MSCs growth-rate, while longer stimulation leads to a growth-inhibitory effect. Contrarily, PGD 2 inhibits MSCs growth regardless of the duration of the exposure. Moreover, their inhibitory effect on calcium deposition also suggests a negative impact on MSCs osteogenic differentiation [118] . Moreover, TXs class has been investigated for its effect on MSCs proliferation, suggesting the role of TXA 2 as potent modulator of ASCs migration and proliferation through ERK and p38 MAPK signaling mechanisms [119] . In addition, TXA 2 appears to induce ASCs differentiation into smooth-muscle-like cells [119, 120] . Concerning eCBS, Rossi et al. [121] described a gradual decrease during subculture in AEA and 2-AG levels secreted by human BMSCs starting from passage 1 (AEA: 5 pmol/mg protein and 2-AG: 11 pmol/mg protein 2-AG) and this finding was also confirmed by Kose et al. [122] . ASCs secrete AEA and 2-AG at 3.5 and 7.3 pmol/mg protein, respectively, at early passages [123] . In addition, 2-AG and CB1/CB2 stimulation recruits BMSCs, most probably via an indirect activation of CB2 receptors [124] .During MSCs differentiation, eCBS variation was also highlighted and the expression of CB1 and CB2 is considerably lower in undifferentiated cells and it increases during osteogenic [125, 126] and adipogenic commitment [125] . Furthermore, the activation of CB2 signaling plays an important role in promoting the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro, with an increase of alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), an induction of the expression of specific osteogenic genes including Runx2, Osterix, IBSP, SPP1, OCN, COL1a1, and an enhanced deposition of calcium in the extracellular matrix [126] . This result indicates a key role of CB2 receptor in BMSCs differentiation towards osteoblasts, suggesting also that MSCs might produce endogenous cannabinoids able to reinforce their osteogenic differentiation as well. Moreover, the knockdown of CB2 receptor in BMSCs by small interference RNA (siRNA) inhibits ALP activity and mineralization [126] . Most recently the osteogenic differentiation induced by CB2 signaling activation has been shown to involve autophagy induction and sequestosome 1/p62-mediated Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2Related Factor 2 deactivation [127] . Whereas, the implication of eCBs in BMSCs physiology related to their adipocyte differentiation was validated looking at the increased expression of CB1, transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) and PPAR\\u03b3 during adipogenesis [128] . Moreover, the effects of AEA, N-arachidonoydopamine (NADA), and 2-AG were evaluated suggesting a promotion of adipocyte differentiation by AEA and an inhibition by NADA. No changes were observed with 2-AG at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Furthermore, CB1 may stimulate protein expression, such as adiponectin during adipogenesis [125, 129] , since it is enriched in mature adipocytes compared to other cell types [129] . Moreover, based on the effect of AEA, CB1 expression seems to be correlated to the increment of FAAH and COX-2 during adipogenic differentiation [130] . Lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in stem cells physiopathology [108] [109] [110] . However, at the moment the number of studies about the lipidome of MSCs is limited, and mainly focused on variations in lipid composition during stem cell proliferation and differentiation [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] (Figure 2 ). Recently, profiles of glycerophopholipids (GPLs) present in human BMSCs were assessed from young and old donors and across passages during in vitro culture [111] [112] [113] . In particular, since the clinical use of MSCs demands sequential ex vivo expansion, the determination of GPL profiles through the different steps of the in vitro culture represents a crucial and relevant advancement. In general, long-term culturing could contribute to the decrease of the proliferation and the differentiation potential, shorten the telomers, and accumulate \\u03c96 PUFAs with signaling roles, consequently promoting inflammation [114, 115] . It is well established that membrane GPLs provide precursors for signaling lipids that modulate cellular functions, and small changes in their compositions can lead to significant biological consequences. Kilpinen et al. studied the effect of the donor's age and cell doublings on the profile of GPLs of human BMSCs, demonstrating that an exten- In addition, Pagano et al. found out that ASCs exposed to the synthetic cannabinoid WIN55,212-2 increase the glucose uptake, the calcium influx, and the expression of the adipogenesis regulator PPAR-\\u03b3; contrarily, these effects are inhibited by the specific CB1antagonist Rimonabant [131] . Finally, Silva et al. has analyzed the lipidome of rabbit ASCs and MDSCs and their adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation identifying 1687 lipid species [132] . These animal MSCs have shown different lipid profiles as well as changes in lipid composition after adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, the N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) expression levels suggest lipid similarities in cells differentiated from different stem cell sources [132] . In conclusion, PUFAs and their bioactive derivatives affect both the proliferation and differentiation of several MSCs and consequently modulate their immunological interaction with other cells. In this perspective, lipid profiling can represent a valuable tool also in the screening of MSC populations prior to their use in both experimental and clinical settings. Indeed, the possibility of evaluating selected lipid classes or MSC entire lipidome can rapidly provide a screenshot of their differentiative status and growth rate, thus, allowing to harness MSC potential at its best for the diverse applications.MSCs present anti-inflammatory properties and are being used with great success as treatment for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. They have been shown to migrate towards injured tissues affected by inflammatory events, led by several growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines [133] . Being physiologically recruited at the damaged site, MSCs are often submitted to a strong, pro-inflammatory environment. It is well known that the PGE 2 secretion is increased upon incubation with the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\\u03b1) and the interferon gamma (IFN-\\u03b3) [28] . To better understand the involvement of the lipidome in the MSCs anti-inflammatory properties and underlying its mechanisms of action, Campos et al. [134] have performed a wide range lipidomic analysis of MSCs under pro-inflammatory conditions induced by the presence of 10 ng/mL TNF-\\u03b1 and 500 U/mL IFN-\\u03b3. This study has evidenced a change in MSCs PL profile under the pro-inflammatory stimulus: indeed, higher levels of molecular PC species with longer FA acyl chains and lower levels of molecular PC species with shorter FA acyl chains were assessed. Moreover, the expressions of the specific PE(40:6), PS(36:1), LPC(18:0), and SM(34:0) were enhanced, while PE(O-38:6) and PS(40:4) expressions decreased simultaneously. The increase of LPC (18:0) has already been correlated with anti-inflammatory properties by others [135, 136] . These differences were identified only in specific GPL subspecies, suggesting that each GPL subspecies could play a role in MSCs immunological functions. Moreover, the characteristics of the lipidome of the untreated MSCs described by Campos et al. were consistent with previous results [111] , with the exception of the presence of sphingomyelins [134] , which have not been previously identified. As formerly described, some derivatives of SLs, such as S1P, are bioactive and mediate essential cell functions [137] .Concerning the MSCs lipid secretion, PGE 2 was widely investigated given its key role in the immunosuppressive activity of MSCs [28] . Masoodi and colleagues [138] have analyzed the release of PGs by human heart-derived MSCs by HPLC-MS/MS, finding the presence of PGE 1 , PGE 2 , PGE 3 , 6-keto PGF 1\\u03b1 , PGF 2\\u03b1 , and PGJ 2 in the conditioned medium. Although PGE 2 has been linked to the immunosuppressive effects of MSCs since their inhibitors production attenuate MSC-mediated immunomodulation [28] , PGs are best known for their ability to mediate vasodilatation that allows immune cells to invade inflamed tissue. Indeed, recent evidence suggests also that PGE 2 may have an immunostimulatory role by facilitating Th1 differentiation and expanding the Th17 Tcells population [55] . Since prostaglandins have a short half-life, they act as paracrine and autocrine factors in the local environment. MSCs themselves also express receptors for prostaglandins: EP1, EP2, EP4, FP, and IP. The effects triggered by the stimulation of these receptors on MSCs are still unknown. However, the profile of PGs highlighted in MSCs is superimposable with that of their receptors (prostaglandins type E and F, and prostacyclin). Thus, the dual and controversial immunomodulatory properties of MSCs can depend on the local environment, where IFN-\\u03b3 and TNF-\\u03b1 play a pivotal role in promoting immunosuppressive function of MSCs [139, 140] .In the presence of PGE 2 , also a higher expression of EP3, which is involved in the stimulation of angiogenesis, was obtained in MSCs suggesting a possible correlation with the early phases of inflammation [118] .Recent studies have evidenced the roles of LXs as regulators of the resolution phase of inflammation [61] and of Rvs as players in the immunoregulation of MSCs [141] . Fang et al. have demonstrated the MSCs ability of promoting the resolution of acute lung injuries in mice through the secretion of lipoxin A 4 (LXA 4 ), the first identified anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediator [142] , signaling via the G protein coupled ALX/FPR2 receptors [141] .The \\u03c93 fatty acids EPA and DHA, which are found mainly in marine oils, have long been thought to have anti-inflammatory properties, whereby they compete with AA, by reducing pro-inflammatory eicosanoids [143] . The molecular mechanism through which this occurs is still unclear, and there are no evidences about beneficial effects of \\u03c93 EPA and DHA for human health as well as their role as potential treatments for human diseases. In most mammalian cell types, different exogenous supplements of PUFAs are incorporated into plasma membrane GPL and then metabolized by phospholipases in order to produce various lipid mediators. Thus, the biochemical homeostasis of lipid profile in mammalian membranes must be perturbed not only by physio-pathological inputs, but also by external lipid uptake (i.e., dietary fats). A recent study performed on human BMSCs has demonstrated the increase of the secretion of the pro-inflammatory PGE 2 after AA supplements intake. However, this possible harmful effect can be attenuated by the chain elongation on the less active precursor, \\u03c96 22:4. The \\u03c93 PUFAs precursor, the alfa-linolenic acid (18:3), shows a slight reduction of its GPL AA content, while the EPA (20:5) and DHA (22:6) acid supplements efficiently displace the AA, creating several pools of GPL species substrates that allow attenuation of inflammatory signaling [144] .Osteoarthritis (OA) is a heterogeneous chronic joint disease characterized by the processes of degradation, repair, and inflammation that occur in the connective tissue, the vulnerable layer of joints, synovium, and subchondral bone [145] . From a molecular point of view, the catabolic and anabolic activities are unbalanced, and the major injury response occurs at the joint cartilage level. Recently, findings regarding the involvement of lipids in OA development and progression indicate a possible involvement of \\u03c93 PUFAs and their anti-inflammatory SPMs derivatives [146] . The most studied bioactive lipids, PGs and LTs, have been detected in plasma and synovial fluid of OA patients showing pro-inflammatory and catabolic effects on fibroblasts, osteoblasts and cartilage [147] . Moreover, the PGE 2 and AA-derived oxylipin 15-HETE levels were related to knee OA [148] , suggesting a possible role in the disease progression. Because of the similarities between OA course and chronic wound accompanied by cell death, inflammation, and pain [149] and since \\u03c93 PUFAs/SPMs have been shown to target all these processes, it is conceivable that these lipids could be effective therapeutic agents for OA. In the context of this disease, few studies have investigated the FAs presence in OA affecting patients and their relationship to clinical symptoms. These studies indicated that increases of \\u03c93 FAs levels could be associated with a reduced cartilage loss while the increase of the increase of \\u03c96 FAs levels with enhanced synovitis [150] . All studies performed with \\u03c93 PUFAs suggest that the beneficial effects consist primarily in an improvement in symptoms and pain, whereas little effects are observed on structural progression of the OA disease. However, previous studies have reported that \\u03c93 PUFAs can counteract the pro-inflammatory and catabolic actions of interleukin-1a (IL-1a) on cartilage in vitro [151] . These results were consistent with a more recent study in which the authors have shown the involvement of DHA in the downregulation of MMP-13 through a P38 mitogen activated protein kinases (p38-MAPK)-mediated mechanism [152] both in vitro and in vivo in a rat model of OA. Apart from direct effects of \\u03c93 PUFAs on OA, it is conceivable that \\u03c93-derived oxylipins could be generated in vitro (i.e., by chondrocytes) and these could mediate the observed effects. Another study confirmed the presence of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, such as PGE 2 , in OA synovial fluid, as well as oxylipins derived from \\u03c93 and \\u03c96 PUFA such as 15-HETE (derived from AA), 17-HDHA (derived from DHA), and 18-HEPE (derived from EPA). When the pro-inflammatory response occurs in the cartilage, some types of prostanoid enzymes, such as COX, will be produced and released in excessive amounts. COX activation will increase the production of MMP, inhibit the expression of PGE 2 and collagen genes and will stimulate the apoptosis process. Studies conducted by Hardy et al. [153] and Shimpo et al. [154] have analyzed the role of PGE 2 in chondro-cytes. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1\\u03b2 stimulates the production of PGE 2 in large quantities, and this could induce the degradation process of OA. At the molecular level, IL-1\\u03b2 will increase the expression of the COX-2 gene and the microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 at mRNA and protein levels. Therefore, an increase in PGE 2 production is related to mPGES-1 and COX-2 derivatives from osteoarthritis chondrocytes stimulated by IL-1\\u03b2. Another recent study has shown the beneficial effects of resolvin D1 on OA chondrocytes. RvD1 belongs to the family of D-series Rvs, which includes RvD2-RvD6 and share the common precursor 17-HDHA. In one study, RvD1 was found to inhibit the IL-1\\u03b2-mediated upregulation of COX-2, PGE 2 , MMP13, and nitric oxide and to prevent chemically induced apoptosis in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes [155] . These effects are mediated by the downregulation of the nuclear factor NF-kB, p38-MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases activation, as well as inactivation of caspase9 and upregulation of Bcl-2 and Akt. Despite the high concentrations of RvD1 used in this study (mM range), these data indicate for the first time the potency of an SPM to counteract deleterious processes in OA chondrocytes. MSCs have been demonstrated to be effective in the treatments of different tissue injuries and, in particular, they have been considered as a promising alternative cell source for cartilage repair [156] . However, recent studies have suggested that the beneficial effects of MSCs on injured tissues could be attributed to the activation of a protective mechanism and the stimulation of endogenous regeneration rather than to their differentiation potential [157] . MSC-secreted bioactive molecules and/or EVs may act as paracrine or endocrine mediators that directly activate target cells or neighboring cells to secrete functionally active agents. Indeed, we recently demonstrated the therapeutic potential of ASCs secretome and EVs both in vitro on TNF\\u03b1-stimulated articular chondrocytes [158, 159] , and in vivo in a mouse model of OA [160] , providing evidences of MSC mediated anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory action. Consistently, the influence of MSCs towards PGE 2 gene expression was studied in the pathogenesis of OA. One study showed that MSCs could significantly (p < 0.05) reduce PGE 2 expression in OA synoviocytes after 24 and 48 h co-culture compared to control cells [161] . Moreover, several researches disclosed that MSC-derived EVs stimulate tissue regeneration [162] , and EVs have generally important functions in cell communication and regulation. EVs are home to the inflammatory site and transfer proteins/peptides, mRNA, microRNA, lipids, or organelles with reparative and anti-inflammatory properties [161, 163] . Lipids are essential components of the EVs membranes, and it is well known that specific lipids are enriched in EVs compared to their parent cells. For example, it has been shown a 2-3 times enrichment from cells to EVs for cholesterol, GPLs, and PSs [164, 165] . On the contrarily, EVs generally contained less PCs than their parent cells. At the moment, the physiological importance of the asymmetric lipids distribution between EVs and parent cells is still largely unknown. Compared to the original BMSCs, Xiang et al. found out that MSC-EVs were highly enriched in the cell proliferation and migration mediator S1P by the involvement of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) [166] . In detail, human chondrocytes were co-cultured with MSC-EVs showing enhanced proliferation and decreased apoptosis induced by IL-1\\u03b2, known as one of the main inflammatory mediators for arthritis. The highlighted MSC-EVs therapeutic effect occurs in part through the S1P/S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) signaling pathway activation. So, also this study suggests the implication of lipids and their related pathways (i.e., S1P/S1PR1) into the clinical application of MSC-EVs to the treatment of articular cartilage defect. Future lipidomic research, aimed at characterizing the lipid mediators of the crosstalk among MSCs and other articular cell types (e.g., chondrocytes, synoviocytes, or osteoblasts), would likely uncover additional inflammatory pathways associated with OA, with interesting repercussions in the clinical management of this pathology.In the last few years, lipidomics has gathered the interest of the scientific community because of the recently confirmed role of lipids in several biochemical aspects as first actors. In detail, lipids are recognized as key players in cells membrane and signaling processes, such as inflammation and immunomodulation. Furthermore, cell lipidome changes according to different cell phases and microenvironment features. Therefore, by analyzing differences in profiles of specific lipid species, it is possible to obtain insights regarding lipids interference in cell signaling and other cellular mechanisms. Lipidomics has proved being successful in identifying viable and functional cell cultures, which could guarantee efficient and safe MSCs application. Despite the limited availability of data regarding MSC lipidomics, the pleiotropic biological actions of different lipid families indicate them as promising candidates for future therapeutic interventions. No new data were created or analyzed in this study.

SARS-CoV-2 continuously circulated, even among individuals with preexisting immunity, and since COVID-19 began until the time of writing has caused about 271 million confirmed cases along with 5.2 million deaths worldwide [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) might escape the humoral immune response to natural infection or vaccination [4, 5] , which reinforces the necessity of specific antiviral treatments. After almost a two-year effort in the repurposing of clinically approved drugs, limited benefits for COVID -19 patients have been demonstrated [5] . Thus, it is necessary to improve the pre-clinical characterization of repurposed drugs to rationalize further clinical studies, in terms of posology and susceptibility of VoC, and learn from their interactions with the viral target enzyme.During the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, viral surface glycoprotein spike interacts with human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and with the extracellular protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to enter the cells. Positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA is translated to polyproteins that are auto-cleaved by viral papain-like (PL pro ) and major (M pro ) proteases. These matured non-structural proteins (nsp), such as nsp12/8/7 (RNA polymerase complex), nsp13 (helicase), nsp14/10 (exonuclease and N7-ethyltransferase), nsp15 (endonuclease) and nsp16 (2'-O-methyltransferase), are responsible for RNA replication and transcription of structural genes. These structural genes will be translated, assembled with the newly synthetized genomic RNA and bud as a new virus progeny. These events represent key steps during viral life cycle to potentially limit SARS-CoV-2 replication [6] .We have previously described that atazanavir (ATV, Figure 1 ), a clinically approved human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor [7] , is endowed with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity [8] .

The 2D-and 3D-chemical structure for atazanavir (ATV).Studies reconfirmed, by bioinformatics and basic enzymatic inhibition curves, that ATV targets SARS-CoV-2 major protease (M pro ), an enzyme responsible for the cleavage of 11 sites of the viral polyprotein, a key-step in virus life cycle [13, 14] . The development by Pfizer of PAXLOVID TM (PF-07321332), combined with ritonavir, (Figure S1 , Supplementary Material) showed clinical efficacy in reduce hospitalization by 80%, reconfirming that M pro is a very important druggable target [15] . Thus, other drugs that target this enzyme deserve a more detailed characterization, to provide insight on pharmacophoric regions for next generation of anti-COVID-19 antivirals.Anti-M pro from ATV has been disputed as controversial depending on assay conditions [16] . This apparent paradox reinforces that detailed mechanism of action and robust series of pre-clinical experiments should be conducted to shed light on the ATV inhibitory mechanism and the susceptibility of contemporaneous SARS-CoV-2 strains to this drug. Here, we address additional explanations to controversial effects of ATV on M pro , characterizing it as a competitive inhibitor of this viral enzyme that requires a catalytic water to be effective. ATV possesses anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity against B.1 and gamma strains on Calu-3 cells, a model of type II pneumocytes. ATV reached the plasma and lungs of treated Swiss-Webster mice and protected SARS-CoV-2-infected transgenic mice expression in human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (K18-hACE2) from mortality. Moreover, ATV reduced virus-induced inflammation and cell death in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and lung damage in infected and treated animals. This study compiles pre-clinical results that may allow further rationalization of clinical trials against COVID-19.To advance on details on how ATV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 M pro , we initially performed a dose-dependent inhibition curve. ATV was slightly less potent than the positive control GC376 [17] (Figure 2A ). The Morrison's inhibitory constant (K i ) values for GC376 and ATV were 208 \\u00b1 0.15 and 703 \\u00b1 79 nM, respectively. Next, we tested ATV against various concentrations of M pro substrate. We observed that maximum velocity (V max ) values in the presence and absence of ATV were not different, while the Michaelis-Menten constant (K m ) values increased significantly in the presence of this drug ( Figure 2B ), indicating a competitive inhibition profile. Our results are specific to M pro because, differently from the positive control GRL0617, ATV did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PL pro ) ( Figure 2C ). Since structural improvements on the M pro active site were determined more recently [18, 19] , SARS-CoV-2 molecular docking calculations were carried out to test if a catalytic water (H 2 O cat ) was required for ATV action. Since the highest docking score value was obtained in the presence of H 2 O cat , molecular docking calculations suggested a dependence of ATV potency of water content into the catalytic site of M pro - Figure 2D for M pro and ATV in the presence of H 2 O cat and Figure S2 in the Supplementary Material for the 2D-plot image corresponding to the main amino acid residues which interact with ATV in the absence and presence of H 2 O cat . The GOLD 2020.2 software ranked the ten best docking poses and at analyzing each pose, none of them showed a conformation for the interaction between the pyridyl group of ATV and the catalytic water.The competitive inhibition implies that M pro 's substrate concentration may affect its susceptibility to ATV. Thus, we tested if ATV's potency is also affected in type II pneumocyte cell line (Calu-3) infected with different SARS-CoV-2 MOIs. In cell-based assays, the intracellular concentration of M pro 's substrate would be proportional to the virus input. Indeed, ATV's EC 50 value for the SARS-CoV-2 B.1 lineage varied in a MOIdependent way (Table 1) , similarly to remdesivir (RDV) ( Table 1) , a competitive inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase complex under clinical use [20, 21] . The SARS-CoV-2 gamma VoC is similarly susceptible to ATV, compared to its predecessor strain B.1 (Table 1) . Since the CC 50 values of 312 \\u00b1 8 and 512 \\u00b1 30 \\u00b5M for ATV and RDV, respectively, their selective index (SI) values were consistent with an adequate safety profile in vitro (Table 1) . We first aimed evaluate ATV's pharmacokinetics profile over time in the plasma and lungs of Swiss-Webster mice treated with 60 mg/kg of this drug, a dosage equivalent to its plasma exposure in humans under treatment against HIV. Upon treatment with 60 mg/kg, ATV concentration in the plasma was similar to the standard treatment of 300 mg in humans ( Figure 3A ) [22] . Interestingly, ATV seems to be concentrated in the lung of the treated animals ( Figure 3B ).Next, we infected K18-hACE2-transgenic mice with SARS-CoV-2 gamma VoC and treated them with a daily oral dose of 60 mg/kg ATV, initiating 12 h after infection. Whereas the infection kills all animals within 6 days, a statistically significant increase in animal survival was observed in the infected and ATV-treated mice ( Figure 4A ). ATV We first aimed evaluate ATV's pharmacokinetics profile over time in the plasma and lungs of Swiss-Webster mice treated with 60 mg/kg of this drug, a dosage equivalent to its plasma exposure in humans under treatment against HIV. Upon treatment with 60 mg/kg, ATV concentration in the plasma was similar to the standard treatment of 300 mg in humans ( Figure 3A ) [22] . Interestingly, ATV seems to be concentrated in the lung of the treated animals ( Figure 3B ).Next, we infected K18-hACE2-transgenic mice with SARS-CoV-2 gamma VoC and treated them with a daily oral dose of 60 mg/kg ATV, initiating 12 h after infection. Whereas the infection kills all animals within 6 days, a statistically significant increase in animal survival was observed in the infected and ATV-treated mice ( Figure 4A ). ATV protected the mice to continue to lose weight at the 6th day after infection ( Figure 4B ). In the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the treated animals, ATV significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels ( Figure 4C ), cell death-based on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity ( Figure 4D ATV reduced the SARS-CoV-2-induced IL-6 levels in the BAL and in the lungs of treated animals ( Figure 5 ). In the lung, levels of TNF-\\u03b1 and KC were also reduced in the infected/untreated over untreated mice ( Figure 5 ). These results are in line with our previous description that ATV decreases the levels of SARS-CoV-2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes [8] and virus-triggered pyroptosis [23] . Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection provoked severe lung injury, leading to hemorrhage, and shrinking of the lobe, bronchiole and alveoli (Figure 6 ), which was reduced by ATV. This protection is the consequence of the direct antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of ATV, since this molecule could not prevent hemorrhage as an anti-clotting agent ( Figure S3, Supplementary Material) . and mononuclear cells counts (E) and immunocytochemical staining (F) were assessed in the BAL six days after infection in the indicated experimental groups. All the analysis were performed with 6 mice/group.ATV reduced the SARS-CoV-2-induced IL-6 levels in the BAL and in the lungs of treated animals ( Figure 5 ). In the lung, levels of TNF-\\u03b1 and KC were also reduced in the infected/untreated over untreated mice ( Figure 5 ).

However, limited clinical benefit has been documented for most repurposed drugs, whereas in the meantime orally available antiviral drugs against COVID-19 demonstrated clinical efficacy to reduce hospitalization, such as molnupiravir [26] and PAXLOVID TM [15] . Molnupiravir and PAXLOVID TM target the viral Repurposing of clinically approved drugs was considered an accelerated strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections [24, 25] . However, limited clinical benefit has been documented for most repurposed drugs, whereas in the meantime orally available antiviral drugs against COVID-19 demonstrated clinical efficacy to reduce hospitalization, such as molnupiravir [26] and PAXLOVID TM [15] . Molnupiravir and PAXLOVID TM target the viral RNA synthesis and M pro , respectively. Besides detailed mechanism of action, these compounds fulfilled pre-clinical steps of investigation, from cell-based to animal models, to allow further clinical development to be conducted at target plasmatic concentration. Here, we performed pre-clinical study steps for ATV by enzymatic, in silico calculations and cell-based assays, combined with animal models ( Figure S4 in the Supplementary Material). The comprehension that ATV inhibits competitively M pro and requires a catalytic water to enhance ATV's interactions ATV onto the catalytic pocket and, more specifically, with residue His-41, which is one of the constituents of the catalytic dyad, may allow further development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 analogs.We originally demonstrated that ATV inhibited SARS-CoV-2 M pro preparations and virus replication [8] . The controversial effects of ATV on SARS-CoV-2 M pro are documented in the literature [13, 15] . In line with studies that demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to ATV, we demonstrated here that M pro was inhibited by this drug, with K i 1.5-fold higher than GC376 and in a competitive fashion, increasing the enzyme's K m more than sixfold. It is unlikely that the other SARS-CoV-2 protease, PL pro , was targeted by ATV in these assays, because its K i for PL pro was above the threshold of in vitro inhibition.The amino acid residue His-41 of M pro requires water to catalyze proteolytic cleavage [18, 19] and ATV targets this moiety. The presence of 20% glycerol in enzyme assay mixture reduces the water content and prevents ATV activity, that is why Ma and Wang [16, 27] could not identify this HIV protease inhibitor as a potential antiviral against COVID-19, whereas Li et al. [13] reached results similarly to ours. Our enzymatic assay includes bovine serum albumin (BSA) to avoid non-specific binding of small molecules to M pro . In our M pro FRET-based enzymatic assay, reactions were allowed to occur overnight to increase the sensitivity, instead of 1 h [16] . Although one might argue that a longer reaction time will increase the rate of false positive results, the following cell-based assays provide an additional layer of evidence that ATV activity against SARS-CoV-2 is credible.Conversely, whereas ATV depends on water and multiple transient interactions, PF-07321332, which demonstrated clinical benefit [15] , was a covalent inhibitor of M pro [28] . Indeed, PF-07321332 directly target a key amino acid residue, the catalytic cysteine 145 [28] . Additionally, differently than in silico results obtained for ATV, the PF-07321332 is more buried into the protease pocket, probably due to the ligand steric area (781.51 and 493.69 \\u00c5 2 for ATV and PF-07321332, respectively) which result in a hydrogen bonding interaction between PF-07321332 and His-163 that is considered as a crucial residue for natural peptidic substrates [28, 29] .Considering the substrate-dependent inhibitory effect of ATV, we hypothesized ATV's potency in cell-based assays would be influenced by varying the virus input, because higher numbers of virus particles should translate into increased quantities of M pro substrate. To test this hypothesis, Calu-3 cells, which is more closely resemble type II pneumocytes than A549 and Vero cells [9, 10] , were infected with a 100-fold different multiplicity of infections (MOI) of SARS-CoV-2, B.1 lineage, and treated with ATV or RDV, a competitive inhibitor of viral RNA synthesis. The MOI-dependent inhibition was consistent for ATV and RDV. The similarity in the cell-based potency of ATV to its K i for M pro further reinforces the conclusion that M pro is the target of ATV in vitro.The emerging Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 gamma variant, initially detected in the state of Amazonas, was responsible for a public health calamity, spreading rapidly in Brazil and considered as one of variant of concern by WHO. The mutations found in gamma variant have been associated with increased transmissibility, higher viral load, propensity for immune evasion and SARS-CoV-2 reinfection [30, 31] . ATV presented adequate inhibitory At plasma exposures similar to humans [22] , ATV enhanced by 30% the survival of K18-hACE2-transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 gamma strain and decreased virusinduced cell death and inflammation. Despite there is not a statical difference in the body weight between the untreated and treated groups, the protective effect of ATV was viewed in relation to the significantly decrease of SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), as well as a significant reduction in the number of mononuclear leukocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and LDH levels. In the BAL infected and treated animals displayed lower levels of IL-6, TNF-a, KC and PF4, compared to untreated mice. The in vivo anti-inflammatory of ATV observed here is in line with the ability of this molecule to inhibit pyroptosis in human primary monocytes for both BAL and lung samples clearly showing that ATV protect both cell death and inflammation [23, 32] .Our study shows that ATV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 M pro with a mechanism of action different than PAXLOVID TM , showing ATV/M pro interface could give insights for further drug development. The in vitro and in vivo results reconfirm, in different magnitudes, SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to ATV. Further ongoing clinical trials will determine if standard dose, used in HIV-treatment can prevent severe COVID-19 or if it is necessary higher doses [33] . According to ATV's monography [22] , doses three times higher could be used for shorter periods of time, when compared to the life-lasting HIV treatment.Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), tris(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)methylium chloride (crystal violet), formaldehyde, hematoxylin, eosin, phosphate buffer solution (PBS), ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ketamine, xylazine, trisodium citrate, calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ) and remdesivir (RDV) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich/Merck (St. Louis, MO, USA). Atazanavir sulfate (ATV) was kindly donated from Instituto de Tecnologia de F\\u00e1rmacos, Farmanguinhos, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.African green monkey kidney (Vero, subtype e6) and human lung epithelial (Calu-3) cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM-HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 \\u00b5g/mL streptomycin (P/S-Thermo Fisher Scientific \\u00ae , Waltham, MA, USA) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS-HyClone, Logan, UT, USA). The cells were incubated at 310 K in 5% of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ).The SARS-CoV-2 B.1 lineage (GenBank #MT710714) and gamma variant (also known as P1 or B.1.1.28 lineage; #EPI_ISL_1060902) were isolated on Vero E6 cells from nasopharyngeal swabs of confirmed cases. All procedures related to virus culture were handled at biosafety level 3 (BSL3) multiuser facility at Funda\\u00e7\\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, according to world health organization (WHO) guidelines [34] .The ATV capacity to inhibit enzymatic velocity of PL pro and M pro from SARS-CoV-2 was determined by the commercial kit provided by BPS Bioscience \\u00ae company (catalog number: #79995-1 and #79955-1, respectively) following the procedure and recommendations from literature and manufacturer [35] [36] [37] . Basically, 100 nM PL pro was incubated in 50 mM HEPES pH 7. KTSAVLQSGFRKME-EDANS with CAS number 730985-86-1) and ATV or GC376 (positive control), at concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 \\u00b5M. Fluorescence signal was measured at an emission wavelength of 460 nm with excitation at 360 nm in a GloMax \\u00ae (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) plate reader. Morrison's inhibitory constant (K i ) was calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism 9. The Michaelis-Menten plot was conducted for 88.8 nM M pro incubated overnight in assay buffer with substrate concentrations varying from 0 to 100 \\u00b5M in the presence and absence of 2.5 \\u00b5M of ATV. After fluorescence quantification, the Michaelis-Menten constant (K m ) and maximum velocity (V max ) were calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism 9. The value was presented as mean \\u00b1 standard deviation (SD).The crystallographic structure of M pro was obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB), with access code 7K40 [38] . The chemical structure for ATV was built and minimized in terms of energy by Density Functional Theory (DFT) via Spartan'18 software (Wavefunction, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) [39] . The molecular docking calculations were performed with GOLD 2020.2 software (Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center Software Ltd., CCDC, Cambridge CB2 1EZ, UK) [40] . Hydrogen atoms were added to the protease following tautomeric states and ionization data, which are inferred by the GOLD 2020.2 software at pH 7.4. The number of genetic operations (crossing, migration, mutation) during the search procedure was set as 100,000. Redocking studies were carried out with the crystallographic ligand boceprevir (PDB code: 7K40), obtaining the lowest root mean square deviation (RMSD) value by ChemPLP function. It was defined 8 \\u00c5 radius around the active binding site and the figures were generated with PyMOL Delano Scientific LLC software (DeLano Scientific LLC: San Carlos, CA, USA) [41] , while the 2D-plot was obtained by ProteinsPlus platform (Zentrum f\\u00fcr Bioinformatik, Universit\\u00e4t Hamburg, Germany) [42] . After 48 h, the supernatants were harvested, and infectious virus titers were quantified by plaque forming assays according to previous publications [8, 43, 44] .To perform the virus titration, Vero cells (2.0 \\u00d7 10 4 cell/well) in 96-well plates (Nalge Nunc Int, Rochester, NY, USA) were infected with log-based dilutions of the yield reduction assays' supernatants for 1 h at 37 \\u2022 C in 5% of CO 2 . After the incubation, medium containing 1.8% CMC with 5% FBS was added and incubated at 37 \\u2022 C with 5% CO 2 for 72 h. The cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde in PBS and stained with a 0.04% solution of crystal violet in 70% methanol. The virus titers were calculated by scoring the plaque-forming unit-(PFU/mL) and a non-linear regression analysis of the dose-response curves was also performed to calculate the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ). All experiments were carried out at least three independent times, including a minimum of two technical replicates in each assay, and each data was analyzed from Prism GraphPad software 8.0 (Windows GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The value was presented as mean \\u00b1 standard deviation (SD).Vero cells (2.0 \\u00d7 10 4 cell/well) were treated for 3 days with different concentrations of ATV or RDV (ranging from 1 to 600 \\u00b5M) as previously described by us [8, 44] . The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) was calculated by a non-linear regression analysis from a dose-response curve. All experiments were carried out at least three independent times and each data was analyzed from Prism GraphPad software 8.0 (Windows GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The results were presented as mean \\u00b1 standard deviation (SD). The selectivity indexes (SI) for ATV and RDV were calculated through the ratio between CC 50 and EC 50 values.ATV's concentration in the plasma and lungs of adult Swiss-Webster mice (8-15 weeks) was evaluated over time. Animals were treated with an oral dose of 60 mg/kg of ATV for 12-time intervals-00:05, 00:10, 00:20, 00:40, 01:00, 02:00, 03:00, 04:00, 06:00, 08:00, 10:00 and 12:00 h. Each treatment group had five animals. After these periods of times, total blood and lungs were collected. Plasma was obtained by blood centrifugation at 8000\\u00d7 g for 15 min. Experiments with transgenic mice expressing human ACE-2 receptor (K18-hACE2mice), were performed in Animal Biosafety Level 3 (ABSL-3) multiuser facility, according to the animal welfare guidelines of the Ethics Committee of Animal Experimentation (CEUA-INCa, License 005/2021) and WHO guidelines [34] . The animals were obtained from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation breeding colony and maintained with free access to food and water at 29-30 \\u2022 C under a controlled 12 h light/dark cycle. Experiments were performed during the light phase of the cycle.For infection procedures, mice were anaesthetized with 60 mg/kg of ketamine and 4 mg/kg of xylazine and inoculated intranasally with DMEM high glucose (MOCK), or 10 5 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 gamma strain in 10 \\u00b5L of DMEM high glucose. It was used six mice per experimental group: MOCK (non-infected); SARS-CoV-2-infected without treatment (NIL) and SARS-CoV-2-infected and treated with ATV. The animals were treated with a daily dose of 60 mg/kg of ATV for seven days.The animals were monitored daily during seven days for survival and body-weight analysis. In the case of weight loss higher than 20% euthanasia was performed to alleviate animal suffering. In the last day, the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from both lungs was harvested by washing the lungs once with 1 mL of cold PBS. After centrifugation of BAL (1500 rpm for 5 min), the pellet was used for total and differential leukocytes counts (diluted in Turk's 2% acetic acid fluid) using a Neubauer chamber. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) quantification was performed with centrifuged BAL supernatant to evaluated cell death (CytoTox96, Promega). Differential cell counts were performed by cytospin (Cytospin3; centrifugation of 350\\u00d7 g for 5 min at room temperature) and stained by the May-Gr\\u00fcnwald-Giemsa method.After BAL harvesting, lungs were perfused with 20 mL of saline solution to remove the circulating blood. Lungs were then collected, pottered and homogenized in 500 \\u00b5L of a phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktail Complete, mini EDTA-free Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany) for 30 s, using an Ultra-Turrax Disperser T-10 basic IKA (Guangzhou, China).The viral RNA from samples collected in the in vivo assays was quantified through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Total RNA was extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), according to manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using Quanti Tect Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) in a StepOne Plus\\u2122 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Amplifications were carried out in 15 \\u00b5L reaction mixtures containing 2\\u00d7 reaction mix buffer, 50 \\u00b5M of each primer, 10 \\u00b5M of the probe and 5 \\u00b5L of RNA template. Primers, probes and cycling conditions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol were used to detect the SARS-CoV-2 (CDC 2020). Amplification of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a reference for the number of cells. The cycle threshold (CT) values for this target were compared to those obtained with different cell quantities (10 7 to 10 2 ), for calibration.The levels of IL-6, TNF-\\u03b1, KC and PF4 were quantified in BAL samples from uninfected (MOCK), infected without treatment (NIL) and infected and treated animals by ELISA, using specific kits and following the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems). Cell death was determined according to the activity of LDH in the BAL as previously described in the Section 4.8.Histological features related to the injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed in the lungs of K18-hACE2 mice. Inflammatory and vascular infiltrates and evidence of cell degeneration was evaluated to characterize the level of the tissue damage. The collected material was fixed with formaldehyde (4%), dehydrated and embedded in paraffin to the obtention of tissue slices through the use of a microtome. The slices were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for microphotographs analysis.Human blood samples were collected from healthy donors in 3.8% trisodium citrate (9:1, v/v), and platelet-poor plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Plasma (100 \\u00b5L) was incubated with 1 \\u00b5L of ATV at various concentrations (diluted in DMSO) for 2 min at 310 K. Plasma clotting was initiated by the addition of 100 \\u00b5L of 25 mM CaCl 2 , and the time for clot formation was recorded on a KC-4 Delta coagulometer (Tcoag, Wicklow, Ireland). Time for clot formation was recorded in triplicates.The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/ 10.3390/ph15010021/s1, Figure S1 : Chemical structure for (A) PF-07321332 and (B) ritonavir, the active principles of PAXLOVID TM from Pfizer.

In the last decades, it has become clear that the lipidome, as well as the transcriptome and the proteome, is in a dynamic balance and it can be affected by physio-pathological conditions, stimuli, and changes in diet [3, 4] . Lipidomics is a relatively new \\\"-omics\\\" that characterizes, identifies, and quantifies the lipidome and its metabolic pathways and other networks that are involved within different biological mechanisms [5] . With analytical approaches, such as thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and gas chromatography (GC), lipidomics was able to develop new diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies [6] ; but it was with the advent of the next-generation mass spectrometry (MS) that there have been significant advances in the field of lipidomics [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In a typical lipidomic workflow, lipids are extracted from the biological matrices using organic solvents and analyzed by direct infusion into a mass spectrometer (technique known as \\\"shotgun\\\" lipidomics), or separated by liquid (LC) or gas chromatography (GC), prior to detection by MS. These two approaches are complementary, since the \\\"shotgun\\\" method allows a larger lipid profiling by simultaneous identification of several classes of lipids, meanwhile LC or GC/MS enable a more targeted analysis with the detection of structurally similar lipids belonging to a single class [12] [13] [14] . In both methods, the quantification is performed using a ratio against internal standard(s), which is routinely added for sample normalization and matrix effect influence correction. Internal standard structures and physicochemical properties are representative of the endogenous lipid species of interest and are added at the earliest possible step during sample preparation. For shotgun lipidomics, a semiquantification is generally possible by using exogenous lipids representative of the main lipid classes of interest; whereas for targeted lipidomics, labeled lipids (i.e., deuterated internal standards) should be included for absolute quantification. In the last few years, the aforementioned advanced analytical techniques have led to multiple improvements in lipidomics, particularly in the extraction methods and bioinformatics. These enhancements have allowed important goals, such as the identification of several lipid-based biomarkers, useful as diagnostic tools [5, 10] . However, the number of lipidomics studies in the field of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remains rather limited, especially when compared to the numerous investigations about their transcriptome and proteome. Thus, the objective of the current review was to focus on recently highlighted roles of specific bioactive lipid species and their involvement in the MSCs-related inflammatory scenario.MSCs are non-hematopoietic multipotent progenitor cells with the ability to differentiate into different mesodermal lineages including osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes [15, 16] . The three criteria adopted by the International Society for Cellular Therapy to define and identify MSCs are: (1) MSCs must be adherent to plastic under standard culture conditions;(2) their phenotypes must present the expression of CD105, CD73, and CD90 and lack the expression of the hematopoietic cell surface markers CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79\\u03b1, or CD19 and HLA-DR; (3) they must be able to differentiate under stimulation in vitro into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondroblasts [17, 18] . MSCs are currently being studied in many preclinical and clinical applications. In particular, they have attracted the scientific interest for their ability to regulate inflammatory processes and promote tissue repair due to their multi-lineage differentiation potential, pro-angiogenic characteristics, and immune-modulatory properties [19] [20] [21] . Recently, MSC-based treatment has been proposed as a suitable therapeutic approach for the severe acute respiratory infection caused by the corona virus SARS-CoV-2. In the COVID-19 scenario, where the immune system produces large amounts of inflammatory factors, the MSC therapy can prevent the storm release of cytokines by the immune system and promote endogenous repair through their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and reparative properties [22, 23] .Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of MSCs, largely mediated by paracrine signaling [24] , is currently under investigation for several degenerative, autoimmune, and inflammatory disorders, as well as the exact mechanisms underlying their effect [21] . Nevertheless, it is very likely that either a direct cell-cell contact and/or the secretion of soluble factors, including bioactive lipids, and/or extracellular vesicles (EVs) are needed [24] [25] [26] .Generally, MSCs can modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses in vitro and in vivo due to their ability to inhibit T-cell proliferation and dendritic cell maturation, recruit regulatory T-cells, and modulate B-cell functions [21, 27, 28] . Expanded for the first time from human bone marrow (BM), MSCs can also be collected and cultured from several sources including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, or umbilical cord blood and expanded ex vivo for clinical use [29, 30] . Compared to BMs, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have an easier and faster growth in culture, age with a lower rate, maintain the mesenchymal pluripotency and stem cell phenotype even after a high number of passages in culture, and show a great proliferative rate with a consequent relatively high yield (about 2500 fold higher than BM) [15, 16, 31, 32] . Moreover, ASCs have shown a great potential of differentiation into several cellular lineages and a good stability throughout long-term cultures; they are characterized by immunomodulatory properties making them immunosuppressive [30] . Moreover, their secretome presents a mix of cytokines, extracellular matrix molecules and proteases, lipid mediators, hormones, and growth factors that are also involved in the angiogenesis process with a great utility and applicability in wound healing and tissue regeneration [15, [33] [34] [35] . In addition to BMSCs and ASCs, skeletal muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) have been used in clinical trials for the regener-ation and repair of injured tissues, because of their high proliferation rate and their ability to secrete trophic factors promoting endogenous tissues repair [36] ; moreover, MDSCs harvesting consists in micro-biopsies obtained as small skin punctures under local anesthesia [37, 38] . Although they exhibit slow-growing adherent behavior after isolation, MDSCs are characterized by a long-term self-renewal, and an easy differentiation into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes in vitro [37] .Endogenous bioactive lipids cover a pivotal role in very important biological phenomena, such as inflammation, immune regulation, and maintenance of homeostasis [39, 40] . Indeed, defects in their metabolism and unbalanced biosynthesis are involved in the pathogenesis and clinical course of chronic inflammation diseases [39, 40] . Based on their biosynthesis, bioactive lipids can be grouped into different families (Table 1) : polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)-derived mediators (generally known as eicosanoids), endocannabinoids (eCBs), and lysophospholipids (LPLs) [41] . Bioactive lipids derived from PUFA can be further divided into two subgroups: one is represented by \\u03c96 arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 \\u03c96)-derived lipid mediators, including prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes (LTs), thromboxanes (TXs), and lipoxins (LXs); the other includes \\u03c93-PUFA-derived lipid mediators, such as the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 \\u03c93) and the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 \\u03c93), i.e., E-series and D-series resolvins (Rvs), protectins (PDs), and maresins (MaRs), collectively termed \\\"specialized pro-resolving mediators\\\" (SPMs). Except for LXs, \\u03c96-PUFA-derived lipids are pro-inflammatory, in contrast with \\u03c93-PUFA-derived lipids, which act as anti-inflammatory. In detail, SPMs stimulate key cellular events, by acting as agonists, stopping further neutrophil influx and the activation of non-phlogistic responses by macrophages and, therefore, leading to the resolution of the inflammation. ECBs and eCB-like compounds originate from \\u03c96and \\u03c93-PUFA metabolism, but also from saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (SFA and MUFA), such as palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0), or oleic acids (18:1 n9). Nowadays, pro-and anti-inflammatory properties exerted by eCBs and eCB-like compounds are issues of intense research [42, 43] . Finally, membrane-derived bioactive lipids derived from LPLs can be divided into lysoglycerophospholipids (LGPLs) and lysosphingophospholipids (LSLs), based on the presence of glycerol or sphingosine (S) as backbone of their structures. LPLs exert pleiotropic effects such as inflammation, vesicular trafficking, endocytosis, apoptosis, cell migration, and cell-stress responses [44] . In this review, we will outline the biological activities and metabolisms of the major bioactive lipids identified as essential regulators in the complex scenario of inflammation and as players in the immunoregulation exerted by MSCs. LGPLs, LSLsThe group of eicosanoids represents the widest family of bioactive lipids and includes several molecules characterized by the long carbon chain \\u03c96 AA or \\u03c93 EPA and DHA as common precursors. \\u03c96 AA, released from membrane phospholipids firstly via phospholipase A2 and secondarily by phospholipase C, is the substrate for three different enzymes leading to the generation of pleiotropic and heterogenous compounds: (1) cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 (COX-1/2) drive the synthesis of PGs (PGD 2 , PGE 2 , PGI 2 , and PGF 2\\u03b1 ), prostacyclins, and TXs [45, 46] , also known as prostanoids; (2) 5-, 12-and 15-lypooxygenases (5/12/15-LOX) synthetize LTs [47, 48] , lipoxins (LXs) [49] and hydroxyeicosatetraenoids (HETEs) [50] ; (3) P450 epoxygenase generates also HETEs, and epoxyeicosatrienoids (ETEs) [50] . \\u03c93 PUFAs-derived bioactive products are Rvs, PDs, and MaRs. Rvs derive from either EPA or DHA and can be further divided into E-series or D-series, respectively. DHA acts also as a precursor for the biosynthesis of PDs and MaRs ( Figure 1 ). The \\u03c96 eicosanoids play an essential active role in the inflammatory response, such as leukocyte chemotaxis and activation, fever, pain [40] , and are usually associated to acute inflammatory processes and chronic inflammation. Indeed, PGs seem to promote inflammation through several mechanisms such as increasing the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines [51] [52] [53] , enhancing the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, promoting innate immunity response [54] , recruiting leukocytes and activating two distinct T helper subsets, TH1 and TH17 [55, 56] . LTs generally recruit neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, and TH17 lymphocytes, and are responsible for the induction of edema. Vasoconstriction and vasodilatation are promoted instead by TXs and prostacyclins, respectively [57] . On the other hand, the \\u03c93 family seems to have a beneficial impact on inflammation, by acting via different mechanisms, for example by working as substrate competitors able to inhibit the conversion of AA into pro-inflammatory eicosanoids or serving as an alternative substrate to produce less potent LTs, PGs, and TGs. In animal models, Rvs and PDs shorten the resolution of inflammation for certain diseases [41, 58, 59] and can also increase animal survival [60, 61] . Two of the major Rvs, RvD1 and RvD2, have shown in vivo anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution properties, by blocking the neutrophil infiltration in many disorders, such as obesity and pathologies affecting the vascular [62] , renal and dermal systems, and also in processes as wound healing, fibrosis, and pain [60] . Moreover, \\u03c93 PUFAderived mediators that have been found within the inflammatory exudate (RvE1 and PD1) show great anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions both in vitro and in vivo [51, 63] . However, the resolution of inflammation is also mediated by other metabolites of AA [64] . Indeed, PGJ (15-deoxy-delta-13,14-PGJ 2 ), the bioconversion product of PGD 2 , increases during the resolution phase and acts as a brake on inflammation by inducing apoptosis of inflammatory cells [65] . The concentration of the lipoxygenase product LXA 4 (lipoxin A 4 ) is also increased during the resolution phase and acts as a stop signal for the acute response [66] . Finally, AA-derived EETs present anti-inflammatory properties through the suppression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) activation and govern vasorelaxation and fibrinolysis [67] .eCBs are endogenous lipid compounds that can bind G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) in the same way as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of Cannabis sativa. The plant Cannabis sativa and its preparations, marijuana and hashish, are being used for many years for recreational and medical purposes [68] because of the pleasurable effects triggered by THC, modulated by the other major, nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid, called cannabidiol (CBD). Both components possess other important medical properties, such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-emetic (THC), and anxiolytic (CBD). [69] . Thanks to the studies performed on cannabis plants and their peculiar chemical components, researchers were able to discover one of the most intriguing and pleiotropic endogenous signaling systems, the endocannabinoid system (eCBS). eCBs, CB receptors, and the biochemical entities that produce and degrade these lipids, are involved in most aspects of the mammalian physiology and pathology [70] . The compound arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA) [71] , the first isolated ethanolamide of AA, represents a partial agonist of CB receptors, while 2-arachidonoylglicerol (2-AG) (another derivative of AA) [72, 73] , is a full agonist ( Figure 1 ). Both compounds AEA and 2-AG belong to the group of PUFA AA-related lipid mediators, and as CB receptor ligands, they stimulate a variety of bioactivities, including analgesia, catalepsy, hypolocomotion, and hypothermia [68] . Moreover, AEA exhibits anti-inflammatory properties [74] , whereas 2-AG shows both proand anti-inflammatory characteristics [75, 76] . Thus, dysfunctions leading to changes in concentration levels, metabolism, and receptors of eCBs could be related to alterations in homeostasis and to the progression of chronic inflammatory status [77] . Moreover, two metabolically active \\u03c93 fatty acid ethanolamides, N-eicosapentaenoylethanolamine (EPEA) and N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine (DHEA) [78, 79] , have been proposed as additional CB receptor agonists [80] . These \\u03c93 eCBs were found to possess anti-inflammatory properties in macrophages [81] and adipocytes [82] . In addition to CB1 and CB2 receptors, pharmacological studies suggest the presence also of different receptors that can mediate the cannabinoids effects. Indeed, besides AEA, other ethanolamides coming from various longchain fatty acids were discovered, and collectively known as N-acylethanolamines (NAEs). Ethanolamides of SFA and MUFA such as palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids, which are more abundant than AEA in mammals, show no activity for CB receptors, but act on other receptors, like the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\\u03b1 (PPAR\\u03b1), leading to the trigger of biological events including anti-inflammation and appetite suppression [83, 84] . In detail, the PPAR\\u03b1-mediated actions of N-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) include anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-epileptic, and neuroprotective properties [85, 86] . Moreover, PEA could also activate the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPCR55 [87] , one of the discussed candidates as CB3 receptor, even though this agonist activity has not been fully elucidated yet. Another saturated NAE, N-stearoylethanolamide (SEA), was reported to act as an anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory agent and cell growth controller, through still unknown targets [88] [89] [90] . Finally, a variety of eCB-related compounds, containing fatty acid chains conjugated with different polar heads, have been discovered as a result of advancements of the analytical techniques [91, 92] . Within the novel group of lipids generally referred as lipoamino acids, N-arachidonoylglycine (NAGly), the most important member, possesses anti-inflammatory effects by targeting the G-protein coupled receptor GPCR18 [93, 94] , vasorelaxant properties [95] and seems to be involved in cell migration [96] , and inhibition of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) [97] , the AEA inactivating enzyme. Moreover, NAgly might have either a physiological role in the resolution of acute inflammatory response and become a potential therapeutic candidate for the resolution of chronic inflammation, by increasing the production of PGJ and LXA 4 , reducing the migration of inflammatory cells into areas of acute inflammation and inducing the death of inflammatory cells [93] . eCBs are endogenous lipid compounds that can bind G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) in the same way as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of Cannabis sativa. The plant Cannabis sativa and its preparations, LPLs are bioactive signaling lipids consisting of O-acyl chain, generated from phospholipase-mediated hydrolyzation of membrane glycerophospholipids (GPLs) and sphingolipids (SLs). Consequently, LPLs are classified into two main categories: glyceryl-based LPLs (including LPA) and sphingosyl-based (including S1P) with a glycerol or a sphingosine backbone, respectively [98, 99] (Figure 1 ). Several LPLs compounds are asymmetrically distributed in the plasma membrane and are characterized by a polar head group (ethanolamine, choline, inositol, serine) and a hydrophobic tail of carbon chain. LPLs act as signaling mediators by binding seven-transmembrane domain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The two major bioactive LPLs are the well-characterized lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and they play important roles in various physio-pathological processes, including inflammation. LPA, a byproduct of lysophosphaditylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidilinositol (LPI), is a signaling mediator involved in cell renewal, immune response, and inflammatory cascade [100, 101] . LPA can be synthetized both intracellularly and extracellularly by different enzymes and via different pathways, such as autotaxin/ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 2 (ENNP2) and/or phospholipases A1 and A2, whereas its degradation is mediated by lipid phosphate phosphatases 1-3 [102] . Currently, six LPA receptors (LPA 1-6) are known [102] . Recently, LPA is reported to be rapidly formed during the resolution phase of the inflammation and, successively, to be recruited via the common pro-resolving formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2, also known as ALX), which is expressed on T cells and their subsets [103] . On the other hand, SLs, such as ceramides and sphingosines, participate in different stages of inflammation as well, by controlling intracellular trafficking and signaling, cell proliferation, adhesion, vascularization, survival, and apoptosis [104, 105] . In particular, the phosphate forms of sphingolipids, ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) and S1P [106] , are notably associated to inflammatory responses. S1P is synthesized by the intracellular phosphorylation of sphingosine via sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (SK1 and SK2) and degraded by S1P lyase or ceramide synthases. It is involved in the resolution phase (together with C1P) since apoptotic cells present at the inflammation sites attract pro-resolving macrophages via S1P receptor 1 [107] and, additionally, it can act either on COX-2 or NF-kB, whereas C1P acts on phospholipase A2 [102] .Lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in stem cells physiopathology [108] [109] [110] . However, at the moment the number of studies about the lipidome of MSCs is limited, and mainly focused on variations in lipid composition during stem cell proliferation and differentiation [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] (Figure 2) .Recently, profiles of glycerophopholipids (GPLs) present in human BMSCs were assessed from young and old donors and across passages during in vitro culture [111] [112] [113] . In particular, since the clinical use of MSCs demands sequential ex vivo expansion, the determination of GPL profiles through the different steps of the in vitro culture represents a crucial and relevant advancement. In general, long-term culturing could contribute to the decrease of the proliferation and the differentiation potential, shorten the telomers, and accumulate \\u03c96 PUFAs with signaling roles, consequently promoting inflammation [114, 115] . It is well established that membrane GPLs provide precursors for signaling lipids that modulate cellular functions, and small changes in their compositions can lead to significant biological consequences. Kilpinen et al. studied the effect of the donor's age and cell doublings on the profile of GPLs of human BMSCs, demonstrating that an extensive expansion modulates membrane GPLs, by increasing total phosphatidylinositol (PI) and lysophospatidylcholine (LPC). Specifically, the effect was more pronounced when BMSCs were isolated from young donors. Moreover, changes in membrane FAs profile during expansion and senescence of BMSCs was highlighted: the \\u03c96 AA content increased, while \\u03c93 PUFAs (especially DHA) decreased during long-term cultivation, leading to an impair-ment of the immunological functionality [111] . In addition, in the later steps of the process, an increment of the fraction of individual SFA was noticed [111] . A significant modification of membrane FAs composition of MSCs derived from human fetal membranes (FM-MSCs), occurring during in vitro culture, was assessed by Chatgilialoglu et al. [112] . In detail, fresh uncultured FM-MSCs showed variability in their membrane FAs composition, likely due to the genetic diversity and different lifestyle of the donors. This study also reveals that cultured cells have lower proportions of PUFAs than freshly isolated cells showing a great drop in \\u03c96 FAs, counterbalanced by a marked increase in MUFA and \\u03c93 FAs. These data are in contrast with Kilpinen et al. [111] . More recently, a lipidomics profiling analysis during BMSCs culturing passages by Lu et al. investigates the metabolic alteration of various lipid species in the senescence process [113] . They applied an untargeted lipidomics approach based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), which allowed the reduction of the complexity of the matrix and the enhancement of the sensitivity, factors that represent an improvement relative to the previously described shotgun-based methods. The majority of GPLs, as well as SLs, were found to significantly increase across the culturing passages, whereas the PA, PIs, and phosphatidylserines (PSs) levels were lower in aged cells. These findings were largely coherent with previous described studies, except for PI species, which were found to be increased during all the passages [111] . Nevertheless, the reduced amount of PIs is inconsistent with the relative transcriptomics analysis, which showed an increase in the enzymes expression with consequential conversion of PA into PIs suggesting an enhanced PIs biosynthesis activity. Moreover, research on the functional FAs has largely supported regulatory roles for PGs in MSCs proliferation. In particular, PGE 2 increases human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (UCMSCs) proliferation through \\u03b2-catenin-mediated c-Myc and vascular endothelial growth factor expression via exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac1)/Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1)/Akt and PKA cooperation [116] , and through interaction of profilin-1 (Pfn-1) and filamentousactin (F-actin) via EP2 receptor-dependent \\u03b2-arrestin-1/JNK signaling pathways [117] . On the contrary, the investigation of PGE 2 and prostaglandin D2 (PGD 2 ) effects on MSCs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation suggests that both their receptors are highly expressed in these cells and both prostaglandins seem to have a negative impact [118] . In detail, PGE 2 firstly enhances the MSCs growth-rate, while longer stimulation leads to a growth-inhibitory effect. Contrarily, PGD 2 inhibits MSCs growth regardless of the duration of the exposure. Moreover, their inhibitory effect on calcium deposition also suggests a negative impact on MSCs osteogenic differentiation [118] . Moreover, TXs class has been investigated for its effect on MSCs proliferation, suggesting the role of TXA 2 as potent modulator of ASCs migration and proliferation through ERK and p38 MAPK signaling mechanisms [119] . In addition, TXA 2 appears to induce ASCs differentiation into smooth-muscle-like cells [119, 120] . Concerning eCBS, Rossi et al. [121] described a gradual decrease during subculture in AEA and 2-AG levels secreted by human BMSCs starting from passage 1 (AEA: 5 pmol/mg protein and 2-AG: 11 pmol/mg protein 2-AG) and this finding was also confirmed by Kose et al. [122] . ASCs secrete AEA and 2-AG at 3.5 and 7.3 pmol/mg protein, respectively, at early passages [123] . In addition, 2-AG and CB1/CB2 stimulation recruits BMSCs, most probably via an indirect activation of CB2 receptors [124] .During MSCs differentiation, eCBS variation was also highlighted and the expression of CB1 and CB2 is considerably lower in undifferentiated cells and it increases during osteogenic [125, 126] and adipogenic commitment [125] . Furthermore, the activation of CB2 signaling plays an important role in promoting the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro, with an increase of alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), an induction of the expression of specific osteogenic genes including Runx2, Osterix, IBSP, SPP1, OCN, COL1a1, and an enhanced deposition of calcium in the extracellular matrix [126] . This result indicates a key role of CB2 receptor in BMSCs differentiation towards osteoblasts, suggesting also that MSCs might produce endogenous cannabinoids able to reinforce their osteogenic differentiation as well. Moreover, the knockdown of CB2 receptor in BMSCs by small interference RNA (siRNA) inhibits ALP activity and mineralization [126] . Most recently the osteogenic differentiation induced by CB2 signaling activation has been shown to involve autophagy induction and sequestosome 1/p62-mediated Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2Related Factor 2 deactivation [127] . Whereas, the implication of eCBs in BMSCs physiology related to their adipocyte differentiation was validated looking at the increased expression of CB1, transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) and PPAR\\u03b3 during adipogenesis [128] . Moreover, the effects of AEA, N-arachidonoydopamine (NADA), and 2-AG were evaluated suggesting a promotion of adipocyte differentiation by AEA and an inhibition by NADA. No changes were observed with 2-AG at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Furthermore, CB1 may stimulate protein expression, such as adiponectin during adipogenesis [125, 129] , since it is enriched in mature adipocytes compared to other cell types [129] . Moreover, based on the effect of AEA, CB1 expression seems to be correlated to the increment of FAAH and COX-2 during adipogenic differentiation [130] . Lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in stem cells physiopathology [108] [109] [110] . However, at the moment the number of studies about the lipidome of MSCs is limited, and mainly focused on variations in lipid composition during stem cell proliferation and differentiation [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] (Figure 2 ). Recently, profiles of glycerophopholipids (GPLs) present in human BMSCs were assessed from young and old donors and across passages during in vitro culture [111] [112] [113] . In particular, since the clinical use of MSCs demands sequential ex vivo expansion, the determination of GPL profiles through the different steps of the in vitro culture represents a crucial and relevant advancement. In general, long-term culturing could contribute to the decrease of the proliferation and the differentiation potential, shorten the telomers, and accumulate \\u03c96 PUFAs with signaling roles, consequently promoting inflammation [114, 115] . It is well established that membrane GPLs provide precursors for signaling lipids that modulate cellular functions, and small changes in their compositions can lead to significant biological consequences. Kilpinen et al. studied the effect of the donor's age and cell doublings on the profile of GPLs of human BMSCs, demonstrating that an exten- In addition, Pagano et al. found out that ASCs exposed to the synthetic cannabinoid WIN55,212-2 increase the glucose uptake, the calcium influx, and the expression of the adipogenesis regulator PPAR-\\u03b3; contrarily, these effects are inhibited by the specific CB1antagonist Rimonabant [131] . Finally, Silva et al. has analyzed the lipidome of rabbit ASCs and MDSCs and their adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation identifying 1687 lipid species [132] . These animal MSCs have shown different lipid profiles as well as changes in lipid composition after adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, the N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) expression levels suggest lipid similarities in cells differentiated from different stem cell sources [132] . In conclusion, PUFAs and their bioactive derivatives affect both the proliferation and differentiation of several MSCs and consequently modulate their immunological interaction with other cells. In this perspective, lipid profiling can represent a valuable tool also in the screening of MSC populations prior to their use in both experimental and clinical settings. Indeed, the possibility of evaluating selected lipid classes or MSC entire lipidome can rapidly provide a screenshot of their differentiative status and growth rate, thus, allowing to harness MSC potential at its best for the diverse applications.MSCs present anti-inflammatory properties and are being used with great success as treatment for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. They have been shown to migrate towards injured tissues affected by inflammatory events, led by several growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines [133] . Being physiologically recruited at the damaged site, MSCs are often submitted to a strong, pro-inflammatory environment. It is well known that the PGE 2 secretion is increased upon incubation with the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\\u03b1) and the interferon gamma (IFN-\\u03b3) [28] . To better understand the involvement of the lipidome in the MSCs anti-inflammatory properties and underlying its mechanisms of action, Campos et al. [134] have performed a wide range lipidomic analysis of MSCs under pro-inflammatory conditions induced by the presence of 10 ng/mL TNF-\\u03b1 and 500 U/mL IFN-\\u03b3. This study has evidenced a change in MSCs PL profile under the pro-inflammatory stimulus: indeed, higher levels of molecular PC species with longer FA acyl chains and lower levels of molecular PC species with shorter FA acyl chains were assessed. Moreover, the expressions of the specific PE(40:6), PS(36:1), LPC(18:0), and SM(34:0) were enhanced, while PE(O-38:6) and PS(40:4) expressions decreased simultaneously. The increase of LPC (18:0) has already been correlated with anti-inflammatory properties by others [135, 136] . These differences were identified only in specific GPL subspecies, suggesting that each GPL subspecies could play a role in MSCs immunological functions. Moreover, the characteristics of the lipidome of the untreated MSCs described by Campos et al. were consistent with previous results [111] , with the exception of the presence of sphingomyelins [134] , which have not been previously identified. As formerly described, some derivatives of SLs, such as S1P, are bioactive and mediate essential cell functions [137] .Concerning the MSCs lipid secretion, PGE 2 was widely investigated given its key role in the immunosuppressive activity of MSCs [28] . Masoodi and colleagues [138] have analyzed the release of PGs by human heart-derived MSCs by HPLC-MS/MS, finding the presence of PGE 1 , PGE 2 , PGE 3 , 6-keto PGF 1\\u03b1 , PGF 2\\u03b1 , and PGJ 2 in the conditioned medium. Although PGE 2 has been linked to the immunosuppressive effects of MSCs since their inhibitors production attenuate MSC-mediated immunomodulation [28] , PGs are best known for their ability to mediate vasodilatation that allows immune cells to invade inflamed tissue. Indeed, recent evidence suggests also that PGE 2 may have an immunostimulatory role by facilitating Th1 differentiation and expanding the Th17 Tcells population [55] . Since prostaglandins have a short half-life, they act as paracrine and autocrine factors in the local environment. MSCs themselves also express receptors for prostaglandins: EP1, EP2, EP4, FP, and IP. The effects triggered by the stimulation of these receptors on MSCs are still unknown. However, the profile of PGs highlighted in MSCs is superimposable with that of their receptors (prostaglandins type E and F, and prostacyclin). Thus, the dual and controversial immunomodulatory properties of MSCs can depend on the local environment, where IFN-\\u03b3 and TNF-\\u03b1 play a pivotal role in promoting immunosuppressive function of MSCs [139, 140] .In the presence of PGE 2 , also a higher expression of EP3, which is involved in the stimulation of angiogenesis, was obtained in MSCs suggesting a possible correlation with the early phases of inflammation [118] .Recent studies have evidenced the roles of LXs as regulators of the resolution phase of inflammation [61] and of Rvs as players in the immunoregulation of MSCs [141] . Fang et al. have demonstrated the MSCs ability of promoting the resolution of acute lung injuries in mice through the secretion of lipoxin A 4 (LXA 4 ), the first identified anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediator [142] , signaling via the G protein coupled ALX/FPR2 receptors [141] .The \\u03c93 fatty acids EPA and DHA, which are found mainly in marine oils, have long been thought to have anti-inflammatory properties, whereby they compete with AA, by reducing pro-inflammatory eicosanoids [143] . The molecular mechanism through which this occurs is still unclear, and there are no evidences about beneficial effects of \\u03c93 EPA and DHA for human health as well as their role as potential treatments for human diseases. In most mammalian cell types, different exogenous supplements of PUFAs are incorporated into plasma membrane GPL and then metabolized by phospholipases in order to produce various lipid mediators. Thus, the biochemical homeostasis of lipid profile in mammalian membranes must be perturbed not only by physio-pathological inputs, but also by external lipid uptake (i.e., dietary fats). A recent study performed on human BMSCs has demonstrated the increase of the secretion of the pro-inflammatory PGE 2 after AA supplements intake. However, this possible harmful effect can be attenuated by the chain elongation on the less active precursor, \\u03c96 22:4. The \\u03c93 PUFAs precursor, the alfa-linolenic acid (18:3), shows a slight reduction of its GPL AA content, while the EPA (20:5) and DHA (22:6) acid supplements efficiently displace the AA, creating several pools of GPL species substrates that allow attenuation of inflammatory signaling [144] .Osteoarthritis (OA) is a heterogeneous chronic joint disease characterized by the processes of degradation, repair, and inflammation that occur in the connective tissue, the vulnerable layer of joints, synovium, and subchondral bone [145] . From a molecular point of view, the catabolic and anabolic activities are unbalanced, and the major injury response occurs at the joint cartilage level. Recently, findings regarding the involvement of lipids in OA development and progression indicate a possible involvement of \\u03c93 PUFAs and their anti-inflammatory SPMs derivatives [146] . The most studied bioactive lipids, PGs and LTs, have been detected in plasma and synovial fluid of OA patients showing pro-inflammatory and catabolic effects on fibroblasts, osteoblasts and cartilage [147] . Moreover, the PGE 2 and AA-derived oxylipin 15-HETE levels were related to knee OA [148] , suggesting a possible role in the disease progression. Because of the similarities between OA course and chronic wound accompanied by cell death, inflammation, and pain [149] and since \\u03c93 PUFAs/SPMs have been shown to target all these processes, it is conceivable that these lipids could be effective therapeutic agents for OA. In the context of this disease, few studies have investigated the FAs presence in OA affecting patients and their relationship to clinical symptoms. These studies indicated that increases of \\u03c93 FAs levels could be associated with a reduced cartilage loss while the increase of the increase of \\u03c96 FAs levels with enhanced synovitis [150] . All studies performed with \\u03c93 PUFAs suggest that the beneficial effects consist primarily in an improvement in symptoms and pain, whereas little effects are observed on structural progression of the OA disease. However, previous studies have reported that \\u03c93 PUFAs can counteract the pro-inflammatory and catabolic actions of interleukin-1a (IL-1a) on cartilage in vitro [151] . These results were consistent with a more recent study in which the authors have shown the involvement of DHA in the downregulation of MMP-13 through a P38 mitogen activated protein kinases (p38-MAPK)-mediated mechanism [152] both in vitro and in vivo in a rat model of OA. Apart from direct effects of \\u03c93 PUFAs on OA, it is conceivable that \\u03c93-derived oxylipins could be generated in vitro (i.e., by chondrocytes) and these could mediate the observed effects. Another study confirmed the presence of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, such as PGE 2 , in OA synovial fluid, as well as oxylipins derived from \\u03c93 and \\u03c96 PUFA such as 15-HETE (derived from AA), 17-HDHA (derived from DHA), and 18-HEPE (derived from EPA). When the pro-inflammatory response occurs in the cartilage, some types of prostanoid enzymes, such as COX, will be produced and released in excessive amounts. COX activation will increase the production of MMP, inhibit the expression of PGE 2 and collagen genes and will stimulate the apoptosis process. Studies conducted by Hardy et al. [153] and Shimpo et al. [154] have analyzed the role of PGE 2 in chondro-cytes. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1\\u03b2 stimulates the production of PGE 2 in large quantities, and this could induce the degradation process of OA. At the molecular level, IL-1\\u03b2 will increase the expression of the COX-2 gene and the microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 at mRNA and protein levels. Therefore, an increase in PGE 2 production is related to mPGES-1 and COX-2 derivatives from osteoarthritis chondrocytes stimulated by IL-1\\u03b2. Another recent study has shown the beneficial effects of resolvin D1 on OA chondrocytes. RvD1 belongs to the family of D-series Rvs, which includes RvD2-RvD6 and share the common precursor 17-HDHA. In one study, RvD1 was found to inhibit the IL-1\\u03b2-mediated upregulation of COX-2, PGE 2 , MMP13, and nitric oxide and to prevent chemically induced apoptosis in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes [155] . These effects are mediated by the downregulation of the nuclear factor NF-kB, p38-MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases activation, as well as inactivation of caspase9 and upregulation of Bcl-2 and Akt. Despite the high concentrations of RvD1 used in this study (mM range), these data indicate for the first time the potency of an SPM to counteract deleterious processes in OA chondrocytes. MSCs have been demonstrated to be effective in the treatments of different tissue injuries and, in particular, they have been considered as a promising alternative cell source for cartilage repair [156] . However, recent studies have suggested that the beneficial effects of MSCs on injured tissues could be attributed to the activation of a protective mechanism and the stimulation of endogenous regeneration rather than to their differentiation potential [157] . MSC-secreted bioactive molecules and/or EVs may act as paracrine or endocrine mediators that directly activate target cells or neighboring cells to secrete functionally active agents. Indeed, we recently demonstrated the therapeutic potential of ASCs secretome and EVs both in vitro on TNF\\u03b1-stimulated articular chondrocytes [158, 159] , and in vivo in a mouse model of OA [160] , providing evidences of MSC mediated anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory action. Consistently, the influence of MSCs towards PGE 2 gene expression was studied in the pathogenesis of OA. One study showed that MSCs could significantly (p < 0.05) reduce PGE 2 expression in OA synoviocytes after 24 and 48 h co-culture compared to control cells [161] . Moreover, several researches disclosed that MSC-derived EVs stimulate tissue regeneration [162] , and EVs have generally important functions in cell communication and regulation. EVs are home to the inflammatory site and transfer proteins/peptides, mRNA, microRNA, lipids, or organelles with reparative and anti-inflammatory properties [161, 163] . Lipids are essential components of the EVs membranes, and it is well known that specific lipids are enriched in EVs compared to their parent cells. For example, it has been shown a 2-3 times enrichment from cells to EVs for cholesterol, GPLs, and PSs [164, 165] . On the contrarily, EVs generally contained less PCs than their parent cells. At the moment, the physiological importance of the asymmetric lipids distribution between EVs and parent cells is still largely unknown. Compared to the original BMSCs, Xiang et al. found out that MSC-EVs were highly enriched in the cell proliferation and migration mediator S1P by the involvement of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) [166] . In detail, human chondrocytes were co-cultured with MSC-EVs showing enhanced proliferation and decreased apoptosis induced by IL-1\\u03b2, known as one of the main inflammatory mediators for arthritis. The highlighted MSC-EVs therapeutic effect occurs in part through the S1P/S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) signaling pathway activation. So, also this study suggests the implication of lipids and their related pathways (i.e., S1P/S1PR1) into the clinical application of MSC-EVs to the treatment of articular cartilage defect. Future lipidomic research, aimed at characterizing the lipid mediators of the crosstalk among MSCs and other articular cell types (e.g., chondrocytes, synoviocytes, or osteoblasts), would likely uncover additional inflammatory pathways associated with OA, with interesting repercussions in the clinical management of this pathology.In the last few years, lipidomics has gathered the interest of the scientific community because of the recently confirmed role of lipids in several biochemical aspects as first actors. In detail, lipids are recognized as key players in cells membrane and signaling processes, such as inflammation and immunomodulation. Furthermore, cell lipidome changes according to different cell phases and microenvironment features. Therefore, by analyzing differences in profiles of specific lipid species, it is possible to obtain insights regarding lipids interference in cell signaling and other cellular mechanisms. Lipidomics has proved being successful in identifying viable and functional cell cultures, which could guarantee efficient and safe MSCs application. Despite the limited availability of data regarding MSC lipidomics, the pleiotropic biological actions of different lipid families indicate them as promising candidates for future therapeutic interventions. No new data were created or analyzed in this study.

DKA most often occurs in people with type 1 diabetes, but can also occur in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes under stressful conditions. 1 Studies have reported an increased prevalence of DKA in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes with COVID-19 infection. Patients admitted to hospital with severe hyperglycaemia and DKA with COVID-19 infection have been shown to have increased severity of complications and a higher rate of mortality compared with patients without COVID-19. 2 The Article by Shivani Misra and colleagues 3 examined the incidence of emergency hospital admissions coded with DKA in a country-wide database in England. The study focused on three discrete time periods during the COVID-19 pandemic: from March 1 to June 30, 2020 (first wave), July 1 to Oct 31, 2020 (post-first wave), and Nov 1, 2020, to Feb 28, 2021 (second wave), and compared the incidence of DKA admissions during these periods with the mean incidence during the equivalent time periods in the 3 years before the pandemic (2017-20). The authors found that DKA admissions in England were increased by 6% (95% CI 4-9) during the first wave of the pandemic compared with in the prepandemic years. The increase in DKA admissions was accounted for by a 41% (35-47) increased incidence of DKA in patients with pre-existing type 2 diabetes and 57% (48-66) increased incidence in patients with new-onset of diabetes, but a 19% (16-21) decreased incidence in those with pre-existing type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, DKA admissions were increased in older patients (60 years or older) with pre-existing type 2 diabetes and of non-White ethnicities. Patients admitted with DKA with new-onset diabetes had a median age of 30 years (IQR 13-51) and comprised a higher proportion of men and people of non-White ethnicities than in the prepandemic years. Among DKA admissions during the first wave, 12% had a diagnosis of COVID-19. 6% (5-7) of admissions with type 1 diabetes, 23% (21-24) with type 2 diabetes, and 7% (6-9) with newly diagnosed diabetes had concurrent COVID-19.The authors found that incidence of DKA admissions had increased in people with type 2 diabetes even without concurrent COVID-19 infection. Before the pandemic, a trend of increased DKA hospitalisations was reported in patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes during the past decade in England. 4 The risk factors for DKA include low socioeconomic status, young age, female sex, high HbA 1c levels, and a previous episode of DKA. An important finding from the study by Misra and colleagues is that increased incidence of DKA admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic occurred primarily in type 2 diabetes and newly diagnosed diabetes, and not in type 1 diabetes. Possible reasons for increased DKA incidence during the pandemic are that due to social restrictions, less medical care is sought by people with type 2 diabetes, and there is worsening glycaemic control and increased sedentary lifestyle. Furthermore, new-onset diabetes that presents with DKA has been recognised as ketosis-prone diabetes, 5 and has been described mostly in people of African origin with overweight or obesity, with a prevalence two to three times higher in men than in women. At presentation, these patients were found to have impaired insulin secretion but without the autoimmune markers of type 1 diabetes, and after initial insulin treatment, about 70% were able to discontinue insulin due to recovery of pancreatic \\u03b2-cell function. 5 Although the true incidence is not known, ketosis-prone diabetes phenotype might account for DKA occurring in people with type 2 diabetes with severe COVID-19 infection.The cause of increased incidence of DKA with COVID-19 infection is likely to be multifactorial. Enteric and respiratory viral infections have been associated with autoimmune-mediated destruction of \\u03b2 cells in people with underlying genetic risk of type 1 diabetes, either through molecular mimicry or altered immune response. 6 Infections can cause increased insulin resistance leading to glycaemic decompensation in patients with a history of diabetes. Pancreatic islets express low levels of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor that is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 7 One study of human donor islets in patients with severe COVID-19 showed that, despite low levels of ACE2 expression, SARS-CoV-2 was present in pancreatic \\u03b2 cells, which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might cause \\u03b2-cell dysfunction and subsequent hyperglycaemia. 7, 8 In addition, severe hyperglycaemia and DKA, as well as COVID-19 with severe disease, have been associated with increased oxidative stress markers and high Shutterstock concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines. 9 Severe hyperglycaemia induces liver production of C-reactive protein under the influence of activated macrophages that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1\\u03b2, and tumour necrosis factor. These cytokines in turn impair insulin secretion and reduce insulin action. IL-6 in particular has been highlighted as likely to play a role in a maladaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Whether the inflammatory cascades engaged in DKA and severe COVID-19 are synergistic in leading to worse clinical outcomes remains to be seen.The increased rates of hospitalisations for DKA in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during the pandemic highlight the need to be vigilant in patients with COVID-19. The trend of increasing DKA admissions that started before the pandemic has been exacerbated by COVID-19, particularly in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.

The illness is characterized by signs of anorexia, lethargy, diarrhea, variable fever, and in some cases laminitis, and is responsive to systemic tetracyclines and intensive fluid therapy. Limited serologic testing (immunofluorescence assay, IFA) has provided some evidence that the disease may be linked to Ehrlichia risticii, the agent of Potomac horse fever. 1,a Owing to the remarkably high false-positive rate of the E. risticii IFA, 4 however, as well as an absence of confirmatory findings (e.g., isolation or detection of the causative agent), the etiology of this seasonally-recurring illness has remained unclear.Here we report the identification ofE. risticii DNA in blood buffy-coat cells from two horses with clinical signs of SRC. The agent was detected by a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 2 and by Southern hybridization using an internal oligonucleotide probeZ; final confirmation of identity was provided by DNA sequencing. Sequencing results further indicated that the SRC agent is most closely related to the Kentucky strain s of E. risticii.Case No. 1 (\\\"Shorty\\\"). In early May 1996, a 10-9 1 2-+- year-old Quarter Horse gelding living along the Shasta River in Weed, California (Siskiyou County), was examined for an illness of 1-2 days' duration. The horse had resided in the county for only a year and had been vaccinated in the spring for E. risticii by its owner. The horse was alert and eating, with audible gut sounds and a profuse, soft-to-watery diarrhea. The rectaltemperature was 99.5~ the heart rate 44 bpm, and the capillary refill time 2 seconds. Hematologic abnormalities included neutrophilia with a left shift, lymphopenia, and elevated fibrinogen. The horse was treated aggressively with over 30 liters of lactated Ringer's solution i.v., along with oral electrolytes, mineral oil, activated charcoal, non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents, and antibiotics (including systemic oxytetracycline). The gelding had been on antibiotics for about 24 hours at the time a blood sample was drawn for PCR. The diarrhea ceased within 48 hours of initiation of therapy and the horse made an uneventful recovery over the next week.Case No. 2 (\\\"Shotgun\\\"). In mid-May 1996, a 3-year-old Quarter Horse gelding pastured along the Shasta River in Mt. Shasta, California (Siskiyou County) was examined for an illness of 4 days' duration. Clinical signs included lethargy, anorexia, and diarrhea. Four other horses on the ranch had died with similar signs, several years previously. The present horse had been vaccinated against E. risticii by its owner. Clinical findings included a rectal temperature of 101.8~ a pulse rate of 60, and a respiratory rate of 30. Moderate scleral injection was noted. Decreased abdominal sounds and a profuse, watery diarrhea were evident. Digital pulses were normal. A fecal sample was positive for strongyles and protozoans. The horse was treated with intravenous fluids, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent, and oxytetracycline. A blood sample for PCR was obtained prior to oxytetracycline therapy. The horse responded to therapy and made an uneventful recovery.Buffy-coat cells from 8-10 ml of anticoagulated whole blood were obtained by hypotonic lysis and prepared for PCR by proteinase K digestion, as described previously. 6 The nested PCR was performed using two pairs of oligonucleotide primers to amplify a 529-bp fragment of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of E. risticii. 2 Appropriate positive and negative controls were included in each PCR run. Preliminary verification of identity of the amplified products was provided by Southern hybridization using an internal oligonucleotide probe. 2 For final verification of identity the majority of the 16S rRNA gene from case no. 2 was sequenced, as previously described. 5Blood buffy-coat cells from both cases of SRC produced amplified 529-bp bands characteristic of E. risticii (Figure 1 ). Southern hybridization and DNA sequencing revealed that the 529-bp bands were indeed 16S rRNA gene fragments from an E. risticii strain. Sequencing of the majority of the 16S rRNA gene (1422 bp) indicated that the SRC agent from the Mt. Shasta horse was most closely related to the Kentucky strain ofE. risticii, with which only 3 nucleotide differences were noted ( Periods indicate conserved positions relative to E. risticii-Illinois, the type strain.ences were found between the SRC agent and the E. risticii type strain (Illinois), while 6 were noted with the more distantly related Ohio 081 strain (Table 1) . Anorexia, lethargy, diarrhea, and fever are major clinical findings in Potomac horse fever 7-1~ and represent the major clinical signs of SRC as well. Similarly, laminitis is a significant complication in a percentage of cases, s,l~ Interestingly, the gradual spread of SRC farther away from the river as the season progresses is an exact echo of the initial descriptions of Potomac horse fever along the Potomac River. 8 Horses with SRC are indistinguishable clinically from Potomac horse fever cases we have identified in nearby Klamath Falls in southern Oregon, a where the disease is known locally as \\\"ditch fever\\\" from its association with pastures bordering irrigation ditches. The Klamath Falls area is contained within a northern excursion of the Siskiyou/ Shasta ecosystem, a combined upper Sonoran and transition zone that sweeps across portions of southern Oregon but is inhabited by vegetation and wildlife that are clearly Californian. 11 Although the vector of E. risticii remains unidentifiedfl ~ it seems reasonable to suspect that if it is present in Klamath Falls, it may be present in Siskiyou and Shasta counties as well. Available data suggest that the vector is not a tick, but is instead an organism closely associated in some way with river and irrigation water. 2,1~The nucleotide sequences of 16S rRNA genes are known to vary in an orderly manner throughout the phylogenetic tree; as \\\"molecular chronometers\\\" they exhibit only minor sequence divergence among strains of an individual species. 12 Three major groups of E. risticii based on 16S rRNA gene sequence differences have been described, s These include the type strain (Illinois) and related Ohio isolates; the Kentucky strain; and a more variable strain known as Ohio 081. The genetic differences among these strains are mirrored in their antigenic differences. 5,13 It has been suggested that the degree of divergence shown by the Kentucky and Ohio 081 strains from E. risticii-Illinois may justify their removal from the species risticii and reassignment to separate species status. 5 Thus it is possible that Potomac horse fever (and thus SRC) may be caused by more than a single species of the genus Ehrlichia. Isolation and cultivation of various strains of E. risticii from different areas of the country should improve our understanding of the genetic and antigenic divergence of the organism, and aid in the development of more effective vaccines and serodiagnostic tests.To summarize, we have provided the first DNA-based evidence that the disease entity known to practitioners in far northern California as the \\\"Shasta River crud\\\" is in fact Potomac horse fever. This part of California may be one of the few areas of the state where conditions necessary for the propagation and transmission of E. risticii and its reservoir hosts/vectors exist; overall the occurrence of Potomac horse fever in California horses appears to be low. 4 Considering that SRC has been recognized in the region for at least 25 years, its clinical discovery appears to predate that of Potomac horse fever itself, which was first reported only in 1979. 6 It is thus interesting to reflect how, but for the vicissitudes of history, the disease caused by E. risticii might just as easily have been named \\\"Shasta horse fever.\\\"Addendum. Since this work was performed we have identified E. risticii by PCR in three additional cases of SRC in Siskiyou County. The first was a febrile 21-yearold Quarter Horse gelding pastured at Horse Creek along the Klamath River, northwest of Mt. Shasta (sample provided by Dr. Paul Miller). The second was a 4-year-old Quarter Horse mare from Montague, along the Shasta River (sample provided by Dr. Bob Cook, Yreka Veterinary Hospital, Yreka, Ca). The third was a febrile 15-yearold Quarter Horse gelding that has lived along the Shasta River for many years (sample provided by Dr. Miller).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

Although the efficacy of dexamethasone on COV-ID-19 seems convincing, the role of corticosteroids with and without vitamin C in other viral pneumonia remains contentious and unclear. We hypothesised that high dose intravenous vitamin C (6 g/day) used in conjunction with corticosteroids could improve oxygenation in non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia.The 2019 winter season was expected to have a significant outbreak of influenza pneumonia, and in planning for this, the intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital decided that based on the favourable safety profile and potential benefit of vitamin C, it could be provided to any patients with presumed severe viral pneumonia based on the combination of the prodromal symptoms, acute onset, and bilateral (non-consolidative) infiltrates on chest X-rays, at the discretion of the treating clinician. Intravenous vitamin C (Rotexmedica, Trittau, Germany; 1.5 g four times a day [qid] for 72 hours) was administered within 12 hours of admission. The dose was extrapolated from that used in previous studies [3] . Hydrocortisone (50 mg qid) was also given for those who vasopressor-dependent shock until clinical improvement. The patients with presumed viral pneumonia who were not given either vitamin C or corticosteroids were used as a comparator group. Hypothesising that, if vitamin C was to have an effect on oxygenation, it would occur within 24 hours, the primary outcome was difference in arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) to inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) ratio (P/F ratio) in the 24 hours following the administration of vitamin C. Secondary outcomes were mortality, length of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. Study design and data collection was prospective. Table 1 outlines the demographic and clinical characteristics of the 16 patients. There was no significant difference in Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II between groups receiving corticosteroids or vitamin C. Nine and seven patients were invasively and noninvasively ventilated, respectively, 11 (69%) required vasopressor support, 9 (56%) received vitamin C, 11 (69%) received corticosteroids, and 7 (44%) received both agents. Influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus were detected by viral polymerase chain reaction in seven, one, and four patients, respectively. Fourteen patients (88%) received oseltamivir, and seven patients had concomitant bacterial or fungal pathogens detected in their sputum samples and were treated accordingly.There was no statistically significant difference in the P/F ratio in the first 24 hours between those who received and not received vitamin C. The P/F ratios within the first 24 hours between those who received both vitamin C and corticosteroids and those who did not receive both agents were also not significantly different (P = 0.860), but the post-hoc comparison of P/F ratios between the two groups at 24 hours were significantly different (P = 0.039) (Fig-ure 1 ). Five patients (31%) died in hospital and there was a significant difference in survival between those who received corticosteroids (10/11 survived) and those who did not (1/5, unadjusted chi-square test: P = 0.001; after adjustment by multiple permutations: chi-square test: 8.045, P = 0.012), whereas use of vitamin C alone (6/9 survived) or both agents (6/7 sur- Only data from nine patients who were invasively ventilated were included; six patients treated with only noninvasive ventilation and also one treated only with high flow nasal oxygen were not included; b Some patients had more than one type of coexisting organisms isolated.vived) did not reach significance in survival compared to no vitamin C or not using both agents, respectively. Length of mechanical ventilation or duration of ICU stay was not statistically different between the groups received both vitamin C and corticosteroids, and without both, or between patients received vitamin C alone and those without vitamin C. This small prospective cohort study showed that corticosteroids may be useful for patients with viral pneumonia other than COVID-19 [1] , and administration of vitamin C alone did not improve oxygenation in patients with viral pneumonia, consistent with previous studies [4] . It is possible that a higher dose of vitamin C may offer more benefits than the dose that we used, or it works only when combined with corticosteroids as shown in our post-hoc analysis [5] . Nonetheless, this was not a randomised-controlled study and our results could be, at least in part, explained by type I error and confounding. Furthermore, the viral pathogens were not the same for all patients, making generalisability difficult. In summary, our results showed that corticosteroids might also be effective for viral pneumonia other than COVID-19, but vitamin C was not. However, an adequately powered randomised-controlled trial is needed to assess whether adding vitamin C to corticosteroids will improve oxygenation in viral pneumonia.Approval for the study was granted as a quality improvement project for monitoring of outcomes of patients with pre-sumed viral pneumonia admitted to the intensive care (SCGH # 32985), with a waiver for ethics approval.

The condition has been named paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 1 and MIS-C by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA 2 and World Health Organization. 3 Henceforth, we use the term PIMS-TS to denote both of these described entities.PIMS-TS was first reported in the UK in late April through the European Union's Early Warning and Response System and has now been reported from other European centres, the USA and Middle East. Anecdotally, up to 1000 cases have been reported formally and informally. Fewer than 10 deaths have been publicly reported to date. No confirmed cases have been reported in Australia or New Zealand to date.Overall, the reported infection rates with SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus) are lower in children than adults, and children are often asymptomatic or have comparatively milder acute manifestations. 4 Few children have required hospitalisation or intensive care admission as part of the acute infection. 5 Rather than a manifestation of primary infection, PIMS-TS appears to be a severe but delayed immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection with uncontrolled inflammation resulting in host tissue damage. 6 The finding that many children with PIMS-TS have positive SARS-CoV-2 serology but are PCR negative on nasopharyngeal swabs supports the hypothesis of a post-infectious phenomenon. [7] [8] [9] This is also supported by the observation that the peak in PIMS-TS cases lags behind the peak in acute SARS-COV-2 cases by some weeks. 7 The mechanisms are unknown, but it seems plausible that genetic variation in affected children may contribute to this rare syndrome. Both innate (nonspecific) and adaptive (both humoral and T-cell mediated) arms of the immune system have been suggested to be involved. 9, 10 A striking feature of PIMS-TS is the overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and toxic shock syndrome (TSS), both vasculitides likely triggered by infection. 9 While SARS-COV-2 is the suspected aetiological agent causing PIMS-TS, the cause of KD is unknown and may involve more than one infectious trigger. 11 Interestingly another novel coronavirus (coronavirus New Haven -HCoV-NH/ HCoV-NL63) was previously implicated as the possible cause of KD in a series of cases in 2005, 11 but this finding could not be substantiated in other populations. 12 Children with PIMS-TS seem to present with a severe illness characterised by shock and features often seen in KD or Kawasaki shock syndrome (KSS) (a rare, more severe form of KD that shares features with TSS). 13 These features include prolonged fever, rash, conjunctival injection, mucosal changes and raised inflammatory markers. While these features are common to both KSS and TSS, the inflammation seen in PIMS-TS seems to be far greater than that of KD. [7] [8] [9] 13 Other differentiating features of PIMS-TS include an older age of onset (average of 10 years compared to 2 years for KD) and abdominal pain and diarrhoea as prominent presenting symptoms; myocardial and renal dysfunction have also been reported. [7] [8] [9] 13 Additionally, children with PIMS-TS have shown marked lymphopaenia and thrombocytopaenia, coagulopathy, raised cardiac enzymes (troponin and brain natriuretic peptide, BNP), hyponatraemia, Gastrointestinal Abdominal symptoms (pain, diarrhoea, vomiting) common 18, 20 Abdominal symptoms (pain, diarrhoea, vomiting)more common than in KD 20 Vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain 28 Diarrhoea in 50-87% 9, 13 Abdominal pain in 50-75% 9, 13 Musculoskeletal Arthralgia and arthritis common 18 As for KD Myalgia +++ 28 Myalgia in 1/8 13Irritability common 18 As for KD Headache, confusion 28 Headache in 25-25% 9,13 Renal Acute renal failure rare 20 Acute renal failure more common than in KD 20Acute renal failure common 29 22% with acute renal injury 9 and 1/8 required renal replacement therapy 13 Echocardiogram findings Coronary changes 5-25% 22 2-3 times more common than KD 20, 27 No data 14% have coronary lesions 9 Giant aneurysms in 12-25% 9, 13 (Continues) hypoalbuminaemia and raised lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin;these features have only infrequently been reported in KD. [7] [8] [9] Early reports suggest that 20-25% of PIMS-TS patients demonstrate coronary artery changes (similar to the rate in untreated KD 13 ); however giant coronary artery aneurysms were uncommon (<4%), 9 and most lesions have resolved relatively promptly (over a few weeks) with treatment. 7, 8, 13 As paediatricians are aware, KD has a much higher incidence in children of North East Asian ancestry 14, 15 ; it is notable that PIMS-TS has not yet been reported from Asia. Cases of PIMS-TS reported to date have shown a possible over-representation of children from African, African-American and Afro-Caribbean ancestry. 9, 12 Hypothesised explanations for this observation include the effect of relative social disadvantage on disease exposure and transmission, as well as the possibility of a specific genetic predisposition to PIMS-TS (analogous but distinct from that contributing to the ethnic differences in KD incidence 15 ).Patients with PIMS-TS have often required supportive treatment for hypotension and circulatory collapse. [7] [8] [9] 13 Intravenous immunoglobulin (also the primary treatment for KD) and corticosteroids have also been used extensively, [7] [8] [9] 13 with biologic agents and anticoagulants used in selected cases on appropriate subspecialty advice. There have been a small number of deaths, but generally the outcomes have been good, with few patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The long-term cardiovascular outcomes are yet to be determined.Interestingly, in early April clinicians in the USA reported a case of KD with concurrent COVID-19, 16 and paediatricians in France and Italy (both of which have had high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection) reported marked increases in KD diagnoses (without shock but with positive SARS-COV-2 testing). 7, 8 Many of the cases reported had incomplete KD with fever and less than four of the cardinal 5 clinical features of KD. 7, 8 However, other regions have not reported any increases in KD overall during the pandemic. In Australia and New Zealand, where community transmission and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 remains low, there has not been any change in expected KD incidence in 2020 to date in as yet unpublished national surveillance data (http://www.paeds.org.au/ covid-19-kawasaki-disease-kd-and-pims-ts-children). 17 Reported, but distributive shock predominates 31, 32 Ventricular function abnormality in 31% 9 or 7/8. 13 Between 40 and 62% with shock had impaired EF 7,9 Laboratory findings Total leukocyte count N/\\\" 9,18,26 \\\" 9,26 N/\\\" 9,21 N/# 7, 9 Neutrophil count N/\\\" 9,18,26 \\\" 9,26 N/\\\" 9,21 N/\\\" 7, 9 Lymphocyte count N 9,18 N 9 \\\"\\\"\\\" 9,28 ## 7,9Haemoglobin N/# 9,26 N/# 9,26 # 9,21,28 # 7,9 Platelet count N, \\\"\\\" in 2nd-3rd week 18 # in severe cases 18 \\\", however # more common than in KD 9,21,27 # 9,21,28 # 7,9Fibrinogen \\\" initially, normalises rapidly 33, 34 N/\\\" 26 BNP, brain natriuretic peptide; CRP, C-reactive protein; EF, ejection fraction; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SAG, superantigen; TNF, tissue necrosis factor.At present, little is known about PIMS-TS. It is unclear whether PIMS-TS represents a severe form of KD triggered by SARS-CoV-2, or a separate entity with a spectrum of disease extending from a mild febrile illness through a KD-like illness to a severe KSS/TSS-like disease. As KD, KSS and TSS are all syndromic, with no diagnostic test, as shown by Whittaker et al., 9 it is difficult to define the boundaries between these phenotypes (Table 1) .We suggest that clinicians should be aware of this new condition and in the current pandemic should consider PIMS-TS when assessing children with fever and a differential diagnosis of KD, TSS, fever and rash, severe abdominal pain or shock without obvious cause. As with any serious paediatric condition, clinicians should follow recommended clinical management pathways for COVID-19, KD or TSS. For any patient with these conditions suspected to have PIMS-TS, it is important to ensure testing for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR on appropriate specimens but to also collect a blood sample for testing of antibodies (serology) to SARS-CoV-2 prior to IVIG therapy along with convalescent serology. Suspected cases should be discussed with local specialist paediatric services (infectious diseases, rheumatology, intensive care, cardiology) as appropriate.In Australia and New Zealand, few if any cases of PIMS-TS would be expected as community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is lowparticularly in children. Nevertheless, the Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance network, which already conducts national surveillance for KD and other conditions relevant to paediatrics (www.paeds.org.au) and The Influenza Complications Alert Network are working to establish active surveillance for PIMS-TS in Australia. These groups will be collaborating with other networks to ensure cases of PIMS-TS are rapidly detected and comprehensively investigated.
